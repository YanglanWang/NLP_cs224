You know what I do is write for the kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, you read in the U.S.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> as farmer, or with leather clothes, and never nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know a <unk> is usually something that fell somewhere else.
You just have to turn to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle of which I'm going to talk about you.
My circle started in the middle school in the middle school on the middle school, I was the rare of the class.
When I was beaten up to bleed every week in the friend's bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom room.
It was <unk>

And I had to go out of the city.
He had a thumbnail and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- found a lover -- and in the 1930s, I felt the need to start working in organizations fighting AIDS.
About three or four years ago, at the middle of the night I got a phone call from that <unk> Mrs. <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that we have never got to know us.
You could go back to Ohio and please bring that man I know you've found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to stand up with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, we were <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the same one, and we took away from his family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> it became a box of cinders and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked to you was made in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I saved her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart quickly, was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
The <unk> around the water -- almost 60 feet, and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> of snow on a <unk> snow year after year.
<unk> are born when they fall from glaciers or break the barriers of ice.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with your environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to give up and hold them up to the end, while others cannot be <unk> and <unk> in a <unk> passionate passion.
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separate and themselves, as well as we see us sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As you melts a <unk> I'm breathing its ancestral atmosphere.
As a iceberg melts by a eardrum <unk> fresh water on minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if I were to take my portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments exist in that way and won't exist in that way again.
It's not death when they're <unk> it's not an end, but one continuation of their way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> I photograph is very <unk> has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I would like to show you are from a iceberg that I photographed at <unk> Greenland.
It's little frequent to come really to witness an <unk> eardrum <unk>
Here they are.
You can see the left one small boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and the line of <unk>
You can see here, starts to <unk> the ship has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> scenario.
<unk> from water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single <unk> <unk>
So, two couples each with a baby.
I don't want you to get too much into the details of conception, because if they stop thinking about it, I'm not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in one case, the chromosome and the sperm is joins the X chromosome from the <unk>
And in the other case, the X chromosome of the sperm joins the X chromosome from the <unk>
Both of them <unk> and it starts life.
We're going to talk about them later.
In my ground activity I can get two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the history of anatomy.
I'm a <unk> of training, and what I study in this case is the way people <unk> the anatomy -- that is, of human bodies and <unk> how have the body fluids the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role that works in my work is an activist, as a <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features is challenging social norms.
I've been working with, for example, with identical twins.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've been working with many cases of people with <unk> sex with individuals whose typology of physics don't fit into male male and conventional female <unk>
In dotted lines, we can <unk> <unk>
The <unk> generated many ways.
I'm going to give you a few examples of ways of having a sex that doesn't fit into the common forms or <unk>
For example, there is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> whose gene <unk> gene <unk> and tells the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that will become <unk>
And then, in life life, testicles make testosterone.
But because this individual lacks the testosterone, the body doesn't react to itself.
It's the syndrome of <unk> to the <unk>
So, there's high testosterone levels of testosterone but without reaction.
As a consequence, the body develops in a typically female course in the world.
When you look at the baby looks like a little girl.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is happening.
After you do test tests that instead of having both <unk> and <unk> it actually has testicles and a Y.
The important thing to understand is that you might think this is a man, but it's not really like that.
Women, like men, like men, we have in the body something called glands <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman, don't know his <unk> structure, I think being a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, somebody like me have the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> with <unk> syndrome to <unk>
So sex is something complicated. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some ways they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a 19 year-old guy born and raised as <unk> had girlfriend, and sex with her, he was wearing a life like a guy and he had just figured out that he had <unk> and a <unk>
He had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had the 20th chromosomes, and in the uterus -- the <unk> glands were so active that, in essence, created a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, the genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically a male.
He was born with <unk> no one <unk> nothing.
And it went to the 19 years when he started to have medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, she was a woman inside.
Well, another example of a case of <unk>
Some people with chromosomes developed what is known as <unk> which is to say, they have tissue <unk> wrapped in tissue <unk>
We don't know why that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies are <unk> identical twins or <unk> they are tested by surgeries -- it's not to be able to get them from a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason they're tested to several surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is normally based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is having <unk> identity <unk> being black wants to have African anatomy in terms of <unk> terms.
A terribly simplistic.
And when you present a body that shows something pretty different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a very romantic.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children who are born like two people within one body.
The most high case is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> put her sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to wonder: "What do you work on to do to determine whether <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the reporters that don't exist such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace a <unk> between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> are us who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through science, the more we need to admit that these categories were <unk> we thought they were <unk> very stable <unk> categories that are <unk> directly with <unk> categories, which are much more <unk> than they <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that happens much more complicated than the terminology of <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we go into science we get more and more and more in a awkward zone that we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our culture today, in the United States today, are fighting at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but I know inside the <unk> about when someone is considered killed.
Our ancestors had never had to come up with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of you put on a pen in front of his nose, and if he moved it still <unk>
So if I stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a consequence, we have to deal with the dilemma to actually determine the death of somebody. And this puts us in a hard situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you may think that this explosion of categories might be happy as I am.
I'm a progressive, I'm a <unk> to people with unusual bodies -- but I have to admit that it makes me nervous.
We assume these categories are much more fragile than we thought of <unk>
We had to come from the concept of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of the <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were great.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, that I find each so much like that musical <unk> <unk> and not by the music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with the <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> were, for me, the first activists of the anatomy and I would explain why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept, and they took it together with another which was radical and beautiful and kept for 200 years.
And, like everyone remember, our <unk> our <unk> was the idea of the <unk> the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth to birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were about the idea that the political power was coming into the law of blood on the right of the grandfather of the father and then the son, and so on.
The <unk> <unk> rejected that idea and replacing it by a new <unk> concept and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They took the game field, and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the differences, and that was very radical.
And partly they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it's very clear, if you look at the story of the <unk> <unk> that many were very interested in science and idea of a <unk> world.
They were taking away from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to be able to be able to be able to be able to have a vague idea of the right idea of birth.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of <unk> talk about nature and god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, they were passing out of the idea of <unk> <unk>
And when they did, they were <unk> the foundations of the future rights movement.
They didn't think that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened years next?
And women <unk>
Then the success of the Civil Rights Movement came with people from the <unk> <unk> <unk> saying, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the lines of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
Again, <unk> people who do <unk> the <unk> <unk> and again, <unk>
We see the same thing with the Slow <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we should be surprised at anatomy.
I don't want to say that at the age of five years, they should be allowed to have sex and get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> which for me make sense and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two sentient beings at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both of them in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day.
Let's imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before time: June 1, 1980.
Henry, by the contrary, was born in term, was born on March 1, 1980.
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary is attributed to all the rights for three months before Henry -- the right -- the right to consent sexual consent to the <unk> the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because he was born afterwards.
We find other <unk> in relation to their rights.
So this is the virtue of being considered a man -- if I don't have told if it's <unk> at virtue of being considered a guy now to be a guy now <unk> it is <unk> of the happiest man that he doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, on his part, it doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in every states, for example.
Henry can marry all states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So still <unk> categories that in various ways are <unk> and <unk>
And now the question is, what do we do now that science went so much in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy of anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time, I feel like science is <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It looks like what happens in our culture is kind of a <unk> attitude, "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But many people are stuck in a strange position.
For example: Texas at some point has decided that to marry a man doesn't have to get married and to get married with a woman you have to have <unk>
Now, in practice, they don't make any standardized exams to people.
But this is also very strange given the story that I told the first of <unk> syndrome to <unk>
If you look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech "I <unk> <unk> offers a solution.
He says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea looks very good.
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on the contents of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be able to focus on this to <unk> rights to people, because I have to admit that I know from some <unk> <unk> that probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more meaningful decisions, smart and <unk> relationships about their sexual relations than people from 40 I know.
So how do you put the theme of content in <unk>
It's very difficult.
And a part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person might be measured by an instrument, maybe an MRI machine.
We want to actually reach that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States continues to continue this current thinking of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context as the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being killed by killed unless he is willing to have a change of sex, in which case you can live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context as a surgeon who I talked about a couple of years ago that had made birth identical <unk> and then pick them out and put their <unk>
But when the phone asked her the <unk> operation, a very <unk> operation, was told that in that other country these children would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
And I said, "Well, it's considered the political asylum.
America offers huge possibilities for people to be who are <unk> to change for the sake of the state.
So I think we have to be on your head.
Well, to finish -- I mean I've been talking about the <unk>
And I want to think about how democracy, or how it might have been, if we were given more participation to the <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and that is that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about group.
For years, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in investigating the sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average -- not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to engage with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in feminism feminism -- I was interested as a <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what about female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the stupidest question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking the stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing female in <unk>
But the more I thought about the question, the more I think there is something the female in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something on average, something different from the brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So while the <unk> were very clear to find the way to protect people in the part of the state, you can have gotten more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the support of <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we put democracy beyond <unk> to think less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and to think more about relationships.
So as we try to create a perfect <unk> we think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In the year 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where you want to go to live and work, it has the ability to choose between at least a bunch of different cities that are competing to attract new residents in their residents.
Well, right now, we're far away from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't tell with a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they are worth much more than their building cost.
So we could easily go into the world -- maybe maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may be absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But they just spread out by buildings.
Imagine that half of those who would like to live in apartments because they would be owners and that the other half is still <unk> to do it.
You could try to increase the capacity by doing <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that we <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that are surrounding them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the distractions of construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a completely new, new place to build a completely new, totally new, always and when the rules of that place will be built instead of putting it <unk>
So I proposed that governments are going to build new health zones of reform enough to contain cities and gave them a name: cities under <unk>
I later learned that more or less time at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of education.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 hours of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> went through a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the following elections in the next regular elections -- <unk> imposed on a platform in which seeking reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk at TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of tests on users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> its more fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of norms, like those rules that say that you can't go and annoy all the current residents on apartments.
It makes a lot of attention to the new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies out of technologies like <unk> and they're usually the rules that prevent us from going forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala was sent to <unk> a link with the TEDTalk.
He showed him to <unk>
They call.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, a conference room.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities, much more valuable than their <unk> cost.
And I used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York City <unk> terrain that, in some cases, are worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk was described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and a choice for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> was called, and he told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way our country is moving forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk back about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to <unk> a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a place that is about 1,000 square miles.
That's more than 100,000 acres.
The whole world is <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The <unk> leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the TEDTalk.
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed me the TEDTalk.
And this explained what a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that you could go to be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away to the North.
And we also have new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government would need help from countries, they would need to benefit from countries that would help them to help them establish and make the rules of <unk> so that they could all be able to trust that they were actually <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could easily take a thousand square miles.
And shortly after, the 19 of January, voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional willingness to allow them to create these special special regions.
In a country that had just moved through this <unk> crisis, the voting in Congress for this constitutional constitutional constitutional thing was <unk>
All the <unk> all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
To <unk> in the Constitution -- you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17, I passed over again in another voting case, from <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting rate, of 21 to 24 of February, a <unk> shifting <unk> was to the two places in the world that are most interested in participating in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new new center of the city that is building in Korea is larger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years by getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this practical, this is the point where we are.
They have a site, and you're thinking about a place for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow the managers to <unk> and then it would allow them to operate under an external legal system.
A country has been committed to allow its Supreme Court to be the court of the last reason for this new <unk> system.
There are urban planners and cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know you've solved is they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are many companies that would like to be installed in the <unk> especially in a place with an area of free trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would change immediately to another place.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave back their family to get a <unk> sometimes they are <unk> mothers who have to earn money for just eating or buying clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even kids are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it seem to think about insisting that families can choose between various cities that are competing for attracting new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends, <unk> asked me to say, "Thank TED TED.
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a confession public <unk> and that is that, I live obsessed with the <unk>
I love to find, and more recently, to photograph and post in my blog and colorful and colorful and <unk> and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets and <unk> stores.
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I go to meet people who are <unk> usually my money goes to a good <unk> I look at it, and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I'll be from my <unk>
Would you like the color color.
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
To go back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what you were doing for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings someone to have all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I'm suit.
I brought seven pairs of <unk> and nothing else.
Put inside for exactly a week that's all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else that I would like to use here to <unk>
And because I don't know how the woman walks for TED in inner clothes,  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
While I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that I think or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with a Sunday.
This is what I call this call <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look right.
You can almost always see <unk> for less than 50 dollars.
All together, including <unk> took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've ever used in week.
<unk> the color is power.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other people happy.
<unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you laugh at the right people, not just <unk> you will give you <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child that you wear in.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the <unk> or I remember their little <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you're looking good at something, it's almost safe you are.
And if you think you don't look good at something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years that I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain to you in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person on your interior and your outside, you don't look at it <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal word six words for you: The <unk> <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal and unique style is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it again and again when people approached me this week simply by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations together.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, I was going to give you all.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that we have to leave back certain things.
I don't need to be emotionally emotionally with these things, because around the corner, there will always be another <unk> <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little bit of love at my heart and I wake up.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split into two parts.
The left side, which is the logical side, and the right side, which is the intuitive part of it.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be a completely logical thing.
This would be an intuitive.
So where do you get your brain at this scale?
Some of them are <unk> for one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something like this -- with a great <unk> <unk> in both of them at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually exclusive.
Can you be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, which just like most of the other quantum physicists, <unk> we need a lot of logic to <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need quite intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put them to play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a intuition that you can have developed over the years is that it says that one thing can be just one place at a time.
I mean, it may sound rare to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking lot.
It was a little boy and it didn't do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet that playing with that bar of parking lot, he taught him a valuable lesson, and that is that the big things don't allow the <unk> and to stay in a place.
This is a big conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you are a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for particle physics, because they don't play with car bars play with these strange little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover they do all kinds of things weird -- as they can go through the walls, or that they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point was the physics of a few years -- you needed of quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you don't need them to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because it doesn't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, no one saw a <unk>
But I didn't fit well to my logic.
Because if it's all made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't be all the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why they shouldn't have been.
And so I would feel much better if I could ever prove that a common object is also still the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that it's been in an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the piece of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's just at the center.
And then here's a very big approach to the little <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little piece of metal, a springboard way to springboard and that <unk> up on a platform.
And so I did this almost the same way you would make a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip, and I started working all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a form of swimming <unk> which is underneath the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator with me, I do all sorts of rare things, but then when other people go up to do those things, because I don't want to piss you up, or actually <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
<unk> <unk> of inanimate objects are not just people, but it's the light that goes on and the wind that happens to their side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little metal piece to behave in quantum mechanics, we would have to throw it up to all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then you get a <unk> and we pulled out all the air and pulled it down to a temperature of less than a degree per zero.
Now, when you're just going to be in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act like myself.
So we measured their movements.
We discovered that moving in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, there was vibrating. And the way that it was <unk> was like a breath of this way, like a <unk> which expands and <unk>
And when I give it a soft, we were able to make it <unk> and that didn't go to the same time -- something that just happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean to be a <unk> thing, and it doesn't go to the same time?
Let's think of the atoms.
In one case, every trillion atoms that make up that piece of metal are still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up to the top and down.
It's just <unk> when those are <unk>
At the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years. Because look at this, the difference on scale between one single atom and that little piece of metal is roughly the same as the difference between that little piece of metal and you.
So if one only atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you too?
I mean, it's my part of the logic that I talk about.
So imagine if you were in various places at the same time, how would that be that?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it is when we <unk> it and we turned the lights down and look inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in a single piece.
And I could reach this new intuition, apparently all the objects on the elevator in the elevator are actually quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so <unk>
It's more than that, it's deeper.
It is that those connections, your connections to all the things that surround you, they literally define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something about museums and art to my head that's here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months and so on.
A lot of negotiations and stories, it was <unk> with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of the stories of why we did.
I think my own story is just explaining to this slide, and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
I had a lot of education -- I don't <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and going to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to actually make the desire to make it more accessible through technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
better than it shows you a demo for then to explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've carried out from their launch.
So, <unk> we go to <unk>
Look around all the museums there are.
There is the gallery <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> Van <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorite ones, the <unk> the art museum in New York.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we're already inside the museum.
No matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and they <unk>
They want to navigate by the <unk>
We open the top, and you open up with one click, jumped inside.
They're inside, that you want to go at the end of the hall,
Just go forward. That is <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign mark.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information about <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million <unk>
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you really get with 10,000 million <unk>
It can zoom around in a very simple way.
You see funny things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to do it <unk>
So I started to play, and I found myself with something that was happening there.
And I said, "A moment, this looks like <unk>
I went into and I found that the kids were actually playing something.
I had a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a pole <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper and deeper and you'll see that you can actually reach the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take the image, so you really see what you are.
This is where we were, and this is a painting.
The best thing is to come, for a second.
So now we're going to jump over again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorite <unk> "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this work <unk>
It goes up and the truth of the <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts on this painting, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is "the night <unk> I think I had never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are lots of things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely all, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can create your own museum, create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walked in, I've created this function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we just put in a zooming in it.
It's about <unk> at the National Gallery.
You can write things, send your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at the contemplating of these works <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all of the amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they even don't come from museums either.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium does justice to your artwork and that's represented properly online.
And the big question I'm doing today is, you did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk> <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it a <unk> a flying building?
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
Let me tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I was from Italian, all kids in Italy grow with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened something really interesting in <unk> careers in the last two decades.
Some of the time, if you wanted to win an <unk> one, one would take a budget and give it to a good pilot and a good car, and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you made the race.
This is what in engineering, it is <unk> control system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're getting computers in the open.
And as <unk> they're starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is something big.
As you can see, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex on the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for late year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> Uncle <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, they start to <unk>
And in a way, it's like almost all existing atoms and <unk> and <unk>
And that is completely changing the interaction that as human beings have with the outer environment.
In some sense, it's almost like the old dream of <unk> <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> says that at the end I took the hammer and he got him <unk> it -- you can still see a little dent in the <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> What did not <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> insisting on the idea of capturing the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer, 2006.
It was the year when Italy won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of the remember, they were played Italy and France, and at the end of the <unk> he gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end, I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at activity on the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning before play.
The time line is at the top.
At the early evening there are people around here and doing <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
People are doing a fast call and they go to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
Time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
<unk> Italy, <unk>
That night they were all going back to the center.
There you see the great peak.
The next day they were all at the center of the winning team and the prime minister then.
And then everybody left it.
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since <unk> <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> it's not about people, but things we use and consume it.
Today, we know all about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how they <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in their shift through the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago to tag what were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that were things that were <unk>
We then put a little chip, one tag on the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the results.
See it from <unk>
After a week.
With this information we realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist yet.
They're happening complicated things and there's a lot of transportation transportation.
But the other thing that we think is that if you look at every day that the cup that we <unk> it doesn't simply be somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle that if the plastic bottle is still there.
And that if we showed people, then we can promote some change of <unk>
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and many other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about in the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago.
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of use of water in public space, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, the new technology, come to that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop, was imagine that they have a <unk> and <unk> valves from <unk> <unk> which is open and <unk>
It was believed as a water curtain -- with pixels of water.
If you land the pixels you can write in them, show patterns, images, <unk>
And by the <unk> the curtain will open up so we can see in the image.
We presented this to the mayor <unk>
He liked it.
And we had a commission to design the <unk>
We call it the <unk> <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There are no doors and no windows, but when you come up and it opens up so you can go through.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you lower the roof.
Or you can close the building, and all the architecture disappears, like this case.
There will always be someone, in the winter, when the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it goes down almost all the architecture it goes away.
This is working.
You see people <unk> by what's going on.
And here I am trying to do not <unk> to test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building, because the way we interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let you happen, but a building that kept making slices and holes in the water and you had to jump to not get wet.
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about using people to give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels -- the pixels of water, and of projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
Imagine that you could have little helicopters in the air, and that each one had a small pixel pixel that changes color as if a cloud that's moving in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, which moves with other in synchrony.
Could we form this cloud,
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or in three dimensions, but in three dimensions, what it changes is the light, not the position of the <unk>
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in the one that you can reach, and you can see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like earlier.
When the light, the light, it looks like this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each one of them controlled by a person.
We can have each pixel with a input that comes from people, from the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best ballet dancers of <unk> the star of New York City and the <unk> of <unk> to capture their 3D movements and use them as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> in different <unk>
It's so much <unk> in real time as a motion capture.
It can make the whole movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as possible for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our <unk> environment like a <unk> farm -- but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make it all a little bit of a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we spend the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign will be <unk> we can move from the digital world -- the power of networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how to move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in a collective way.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, while in our cloud are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but covered in <unk>
You can move around in the inside, having different experiences.
It can be seen from below, to share the main moments of the Olympics in 2012, and even more, and it can be used as a way of connection to the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of heaven like something you can go up as a new top of London.
You can go into there you can get into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are <unk>
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in your genes, you could improve the <unk> by more precise, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be in better ways, be stronger to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and make sure ourselves?
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe those people who would always want to be more creative.
What is it that they <unk>
What would you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> of the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people would choose creativity?
Hands up, let me see.
<unk> probably had the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many of you chose the memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of you. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something about this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe that is possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> issue here at the TED Conference but today I want to give you the look of a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote a trial titled "No biology makes sense except for the light of <unk>
But if they actually embrace biological evolution consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
It refers to others or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well on one end, is, of course, the one that we are interested in.
<unk> from a common ancestry with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years.
There have been maybe 20 -- 25 different species of <unk>
Some of them have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem that we're very far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is about the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat the <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same protein, chemically <unk> that comes out of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry on the gut more bacteria than the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> asks you about the <unk> you think about the <unk>
The gut is a beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, <unk> it's very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that you can want to have no effort on their side.
It's really like a quick pathway for the bacteria with occasional disruption of some rush <unk>
But, of course, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something probably better adapted to the <unk>
In this vast symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one single and only <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you have <unk>
When I first went to college, I had my first class of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and I realized something fundamental about most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms -- every cell simply divides and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters of the cell cells.
But when organisms appear -- things start to change.
It goes into the scene the sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens the genome -- the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that the <unk> of death of the body goes into evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to confess that when I was a college student, I was thinking, <unk> <unk> death by <unk> seemed quite reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, every time I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still lived in Las Vegas right 90 years.
And one night somebody hits your hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him is a gorgeous light <unk>
He looks at it, and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
He says, "It's George, "I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different goal to the goal of <unk> not necessarily just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted it to be healthy.
I wanted to restore health in the disease.
I wanted to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is to go through the genome to the next <unk> <unk> and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are kind of <unk> rockets that are designed to send the genetic burden on the next level, and then let us fall to the sea.
I think we all <unk> the feeling that expressed Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily belong to longevity.
It doesn't necessarily treat the biggest or the stronger or the faster or even the most smart.
Evolution favors the best creatures adapted to their environment.
That's the only trial for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the bacteria <unk> that they can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish out there, fish fish fish -- yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look at the phase. I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and deaths from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment for us to be given to us as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and <unk> us so much that we are no longer possible to have the amount of isolation that evolution.
A second possibility is that you produce an evolution of traditional type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be: the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of <unk> when as a <unk> species, distant planets are going to be the isolation and environmental changes that can produce evolution naturally.
But there is a third possibility -- an attractive possibility, intriguing and frightening.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and elected by us as individuals in the decisions that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First, consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society but it's what you choose at the individual and family level.
Think of it also that if it could be possible to be able to choose not only sex from your <unk> but in your own body to make the genetic settings to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make the genetic change to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in your genes.
If we look at the future that kind of changes will be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990, and she sued 13 years.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year at the next year, in 2004, he could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a whole sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost near 20,000 and a week.
Not too much to actually be the human genome for <unk> and to be more and more of all of us.
They come those changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin can make viruses that are not only going to protect themselves but they're going to induce immunity.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in the course of the <unk> flu vaccine in a plant of <unk>
Can you imagine something good that comes out of the <unk>
That's reality today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine just two other <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies, but if they could change the cells of their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the <unk> egg and give their children a better chance of a more healthy life, eliminate the diabetes, eliminating the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then that same technology <unk> that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases that are going to allow us to also have a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could <unk> with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a <unk> muscle faster than it allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we want to be we wanted to turn the evolution of before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are elections that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to have them.
We're going to use these choices through a better society, more successful, more <unk>
Or are we going to pick selectively different attributes that we want for some of us but not for everybody else?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more uniform.
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest of all, we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and to inherit the wisdom and the wisdom necessary to make these decisions.
For good or for bad, and before what could be <unk> these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a huge explosion when you're at 900 feet high.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a motor doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a unique seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to flight assistants with <unk>
So I looked at them, and they said, "No problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had already gotten the airplane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot would lay on the Hudson River.
Often that is not the way.
<unk> the motors.
Imagine being on a plane and without noise.
And then he said three words ...
The three <unk> words I've ever heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk about the flight <unk>
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to come and didn't, all the fences that I wanted to <unk> all of the experiences that I wanted to have and never <unk>
While I was thinking about that later on, I came to a sentence, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'll open it up.
I don't want to focus anything in life.
And that urgency, that way, has really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is when I <unk> the George Washington Washington -- which wasn't a lot -- I thought about, Whoa! I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity also giving place to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that I went through things that didn't care about people who matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as a result, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm no longer trying to have no reason <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is what your mental clock is going on -- <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please go <unk>
I don't want this to be <unk> in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, Whoa! It will die not fear.
It's almost like we have been <unk> for that all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to myself, "I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my kids to grow.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> like a little boy.
And for me, that was the whole reason for the world.
At that point, I got to connect those two points, which the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal that I have in life is to be a good father.
I gave myself a miracle of not dying that day.
And I gave me another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and coming back and living again.
You who are flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing is going on on your plane -- and please not be that -- but imagine, and how to do it <unk>
What is it that they <unk> that you still wait to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How would your relationships change and negative energy change.
And most importantly, they are the best parents to <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many projects.
But the coolest thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk>
One day he came to his house after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
It has a total paralysis today.
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design design and animation so that, obviously, graffiti is something that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and I met his brother and her father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and that he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate by those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be somebody important and have a good insurance you can't actually do that.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Does anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way -- they are making it <unk>
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I came up with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead I signed a check that I didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
I committed to his brother and his father there at the very beginning, "All right, this is the <unk> Tony is going to be building a machine, and we're going to find a way to make her art again.
Because it's ridiculous that somebody who has so much on your inner can't be able to <unk>
So I talked to a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research that has a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer -- it draws on that and you register the negative space.
So they're going through making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a cycle of life.
First, they start with sex organs, then with the bad words, then with the Bush attacks, and in the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a life cycle in <unk>
And so the journey began.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and very much moving things from one side to another we had a couple of things.
One, we touch the doors of insurance companies and we get a machine to <unk> it could <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, this is the most <unk> I call him <unk> because when I talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from all over the corner of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, and my wife, and I went to the garage behind and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took the control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought we did something totally stupid and when they <unk> they would have removed the frames on the walls and in their place, they would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to the <unk> shipping ride -- my son was part of my dog, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a pair of cheap sunlight that we bought at the <unk> <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> <unk> and Radio <unk>
We took a <unk> camera, we put it together on a LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- and you build one -- we published the code <unk> -- the software is low for free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says <unk>
There is no hospital that can say <unk>
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using just your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person and that's his room.
There were all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of <unk> sessions from all night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life, and it's looking through the support system.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot outside the hospital.
And he went back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust in the parking lot so we felt like we were doing graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email and this was like, "This was the first time I was drawing in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water, and someone finally came to <unk> and I would get me out of there so that I could <unk>
Isn't it wonderful?
In a way, that's our <unk>
That's what keeps us in motion, developing.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device -- but it's the equivalent of a <unk> Blank.
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to improve and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained many prizes.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up of closing the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> <unk> in the middle of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art.
It's going to be in the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: If you see something that is not possible, do it possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- the computer -- the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a moment.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> recognition technology, I just recognized something and <unk> with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want you to do every day when we find ourselves with something that we feel to do. If it's not now, when? And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years, in general situations and at the same time a bit dangerous time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a mine in <unk> dangerous.
California in <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating only this -- a little bit of fun in the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I have been interested in situations in horrible situations with the only goal to try to look at social issues in ways that we have interesting attractive, and hopefully analyzing them in a way that you see entertaining and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I was going to come up here to do a TEDTalk about the world of brands and I've been grateful to do something a little bit different.
So some of them may have heard of, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, offered my rights to the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What had was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and the content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But this is a very good thing to do that.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a <unk> for the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name of it.
If you had asked me a year ago, I had not been able to tell for certain.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the world of marketing <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've been involved in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be told me, nothing could be done for something as difficult or as dangerous as entering the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that tries to try and try and try and <unk> marketing and advertising, and that all the film is <unk> with <unk> of products, marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call "The largest movie ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest movie ever <unk> is that all on top at the bottom of the end, it has pictures of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title -- the brand <unk>
Now this brand, you know, <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
These people went to the film to <unk> in <unk>
And so the film is exploring all this idea, <unk> <unk> is what?
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> just <unk> it was more for <unk>
He was <unk> forever."
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the <unk> in the title, but we're going to make sure that we will put all the categories that we can on the film.
You might take a shoe and get the most cool shoe you ever have.
The greatest car that has led in "The largest movie ever <unk> the best drink that you <unk> <unk> of "The largest movie ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing you the brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> making it <unk> <unk> MS: And we actually showed the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the complete film is transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this film.
That's the full idea, all the <unk> of beginning to end.
And I would love to get them to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how sensitive people are going to be.
<unk> You have a <unk> I don't know if you're very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> No <unk> David <unk> How much money you need to do this?
MS: A million and a half <unk> <unk> <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be difficult for the meeting of them, but it's definitely going to be worth convincing a couple of big markings on them.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie comes out and look at a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the responses will be <unk>
MS: But it will be difficult for <unk> by the film or so.
JK:
MS: <unk> means you're not very optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> Awesome.
MK: We have to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go, <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought <unk> meant we have a conversation out of microphone.
<unk> the camera means we don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
No wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, it was to present the product to as many people as possible, so that so many people would see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the separate media, is not the idea of that new vehicle worthy of attention that is going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a mistake of <unk> and that error was this one.
There was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> in Google <unk>    This is one of the first images that came up.
I like your way to <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: whether it was free of simulation or easily <unk> or easily detected or easily <unk> that are characterized by the visibility or access of information -- especially in the practices of <unk> being the last line maybe the biggest problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president <unk> even the <unk> the <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to make something changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency day <unk>  like that weird bear that still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this rare rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
They took a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want you to <unk> <unk> history.
We want you to take a story, but I mean, <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would lie to me in some lie -- and there he is sitting there as a <unk> saying, "Son, there's three sides in every story.
There is your story, it's my story, and there's history <unk>
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> in many years -- I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to take a proxy and go to the businesses myself with all of my team.
So what I started to notice suddenly -- and I started giving me <unk> is that when you start talking to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make a big, massive movies, and other ones that make small films, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make films of big Hollywood movies, say that the reason their movies are so successful is because of the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we going to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the movie is called "The largest movie ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with somebody I can say "Are you cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little bit nervous.
I want you to help you <unk>
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there was one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> of the <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as to <unk> solid, to <unk> on bar, whatever.
That's the big look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a <unk> look.
Karen <unk> We're a small brand.
<unk> to the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> we are rather a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget to have other brands.
So doing things like that, you know, remind people of the reason why this is interested.
MS: What words would you use to describe to <unk>
<unk> is in white.
KF: That's a great question.
Volunteer: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something bold <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that really puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It keeps you cool.
How do you keep you cool more time? They get better <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those of the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common guy.
I need to talk to the guy from the street, to people like me, to the ordinary <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Volunteer: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I love good clothes.
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is day of <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of the dark colors, many gray colors, and things like that.
Usually I've got accessories like sunglasses, or I like the crystals and <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand like a brand <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman #2: In some <unk> part of <unk> <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pet pet guy.
They include pet toys in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is <unk> because <unk> <unk>
Man 5: Stop. <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be made Tom but I often get to the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they surely could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first photo is a familiar picture.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings of self.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: You know, that world -- I think your world is the world that you think about as the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come back and start in a place and in my case come back and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk to <unk>
MS: Next is "This was the best day of my life."
You know, how does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I want to be me.
I like different things.
I like the weird stuff, I like the weird stuff.
A: Tell me about <unk> for what does that mean?
What's the <unk> Where do you find you now?
Why is it important? What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
<unk> more than you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be scared. What kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.)
AT: Thanks for your patience, <unk> Great <unk>  Yeah. <unk> Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to go out of this.
There was a lot of crazy all over this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> on your personality, the Morgan Morgan <unk> is a brand <unk>
They were <unk> very well.
And I think there's almost an paradox at them.
And I think that some companies are just getting away from one of their strong points or the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to be -- and it's the nature of <unk> to avoid the things that are not <unk> they avoid fear of fear, those elements, and you are actually getting a positive thing, for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other marks are like this?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are playful marks and <unk> those things that have been and come and come out and come up with a <unk> brand is something quite powerful.
MS: <unk> brand <unk> What's your <unk>
If somebody asks you to raise your brand, your brand, your brand, what would that be?
You're a <unk>
Or you're a lot more a <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes of <unk> are like being playful to be cool as the contemporary <unk> <unk> <unk> or bold as <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> magical or mystical <unk> like <unk>
Or are you more from attribute <unk>
You're aware, as <unk>
Are you like this, traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> you <unk>
You are a <unk> stable, family familiar, safe, sacred, <unk> or sage like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they would have no control, they would have no control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this film of how now they use MRI MRI to identify the city centers in the brain so much for a movie for film.
We went to San Paulo where they've been forbidden the outdoor <unk>
In the entire city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there's no <unk> there's nothing.
And we went to school districts where companies are getting way into the schools with some problems on the U.S.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects that I have had the greatest answer or where I've been more successful are those where I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They went to the <unk> they took their <unk> and they said maybe these agencies have no best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how do you have he figured out how it was success?
Well, since the film was released in the <unk> Festival let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This takes just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just <unk> or press, nor TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to win momentum.
And it's not bad because almost all the agencies that we talked about to their customers not be part.
I have always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get to the people that are pushing them to failure.
I think when you train your employees in loss of risk you're preparing their entire company for <unk>
I feel that what has to happen to progress is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We have to encourage people to not fear the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, forward, I think we need to bring it to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear is <unk>
From a <unk> at the time, we need to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to house transparency.
More than ever a bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said this, for honesty and transparency, all my talk <unk> <unk> has been introduced by my good friends for <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in big opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So let's put it in the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check at the name of the TED array organization -- the <unk> Foundation to be applied to my assistance for TED on the next.
The idea behind the computer worm <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their highest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are systems of control in real time.
If we can compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge.
The gray boxes are not using <unk> software -- they're a completely different technology.
But if we could put a cash virus from Windows in a computer used by an engineer to set up this gray, and we are smart.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray box hurts the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
Is it easy, yeah?
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started researching a research on <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing you knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> <unk> -- I used multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these different boxes, these systems of control.
That struck us attention, and we started an experiment that we infect our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
So they went on very strange things.
<unk> <unk> as a rat rat in which he didn't like our <unk> but he didn't want to eat.
It didn't make sense for me.
And after experimenting with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking for actively in the gray box if it finds a specific configuration and even if the program that is trying to infect it is actually working in that place: in that place: in that place: in that place: in that place: in that place: we place: in that place: to infect it.
If not, it doesn't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because <unk> we don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, let's say, for example, a U.S. energy plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
You'd better make the goal soon.
So we pulled out and <unk> the attack, and we discovered that it was <unk> in two bombs -- a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were very <unk> armed by people that obviously had all the internal information.
You know, all the dots to attack.
And you probably even know how much the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex, high technology, let me tell you, the load is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks quite like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking at the first was called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
We then were looking at <unk> and data structures and we were trying to push it together with the real world, with potential real-world goals.
We need theories about how we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that this is definitely a violent <unk> it must be a valuable, and it's surely located in Iran, because it's where most of the infections have been <unk>
They don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear energy plant, and the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I ended up in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with control of the <unk>
<unk> is that part of the mobile part of the <unk> that black object that you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make the <unk> explode.
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was slowly to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to <unk> engineers so that they couldn't solve this very quickly.
We try and figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number of <unk> is going down in that code, you can't be <unk>
I started to investigate scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 different so-called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in our hands.
And so that there's not <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been from after several weeks of labor hard.
<unk> <unk> in dead ends.
Even so, we discovered that both digital <unk> would look like one and the same goal, but from different perspectives.
The little <unk> is taking a <unk> and making a <unk> and <unk> and <unk> it communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we are really confident that we have determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We shouldn't worry that other targets are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that I just saw -- I was really <unk>
There's the gray box and the top of the <unk>
What this thing is doing is <unk> the <unk> values for example, from the pressure sensors and the vibration of vibration and provides <unk> code, which is still running during the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, this is the false data that is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is feeding <unk>
Is it great huh?
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the room.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in an energy plant, when the big steam <unk> is going on speed, you have to open water valves in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't do this a human operator, for it.
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then you can go through bad things.
The plant can explode.
And neither is the <unk> or the security system of security.
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see specifically, specifically with <unk> from uranium.
It could work also, for example, in a energy plant, or a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> to disseminate this load with a <unk> key, like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms to <unk>
They were able to make as much as possible.
And if you made that, with what we <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence that we have to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals.
We need to deal with the consequences and better we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been done in a lot of sides that people assumes that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the superpower <unk>
There is one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in other ways, our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and give the skills to be <unk> or another one that makes a wheelchair use of wheelchair raise and go back to walk.
In <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They are not different from something you put in the morning, gives you a big force, which is also increasing its speed, and aid, for example, how to handle the balance.
It's actually the true integration of man and the machine.
But not just that -- it can integrate it and connect it to the universe and with other <unk> things.
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, must take on their back to a 45 pounds, and it's <unk> to get even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries on the back of 30 percent of soldiers -- with chronic damage from the back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> or <unk> Human Rights <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can rotate by 90 pounds for a lot of hours.
Their flexible design, it allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and running movements with great <unk>
I think what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back to the users of <unk> <unk> about what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people in the <unk> <unk> around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talked about something that happens very often, people who are very young people in the spinal cord that when they start their life -- at 20, 30 or 40 years -- they collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We also talk about the population that is growing up very quickly.
Their only choice, many times -- for brain injury or some other complication -- it's the wheelchair.
And this has been this for the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I must recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19, he had an injury in the neocortical column, and as a result he couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It's got some sensors.
It was completely not <unk> on the crutches and they send signals to the onboard computer here on the back.
There are some batteries that give the energy to the motors in the <unk> and in the knees, and they make it progress with this very soft and very natural.
AB: I was 24 years at the top of my life, when, for a stranger jump in the air, skiing in the bottom of it was <unk>
At a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all the movement of <unk>
Soon after that, a doctor walked into my room at the hospital, and he said, "You will never come back to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole my last little bit of hope of my being.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs the bottom of <unk> climbing rocks and even riding on a <unk>
But they've never invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms for sitting and talking to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just soldiers, but for all the users of <unk> to everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I've just returned from a community that has the secret to human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of day -- where the fun is serious about it.
And no, it's not the festival of Man <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet his cousins.
This is the world of <unk> Bonobos from rainforests of Congo.
The bonobos are along with the chimps, with the chimpanzees, their closest relatives alive.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known by their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've been so focused on this aspect in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by large, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society where the mortal violence hasn't yet happened.
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the forest, and it has been very difficult to be <unk>
Congo is an <unk> an soil of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of <unk> <unk> stage that has been lasting for decades, and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction also puts the survival of the Bonobo.
<unk> meat and deforestation is making it not be able to fill in a stadium with the bonobos that are in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear laughter hidden the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as the apes -- the love, not the <unk> because they have <unk> sex, and <unk> and <unk> to drive conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobo is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> as humans, they love playing throughout their entire life.
Play is not just a child's play.
For us, and for them the game is fundamental to establish ties and encourage <unk>
We learn <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
Play increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the Bonobos Bonobo sees the roots of the laughter, the dance and the human ritual and the human institution.
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos just taken from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I'm not talking about football.
Here's a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> <unk>
I just think that in this case he love, right?
Yeah.
So the sexual game is common so much in bonobos as in humans.
And this particular video is really interesting because <unk> this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements to play -- like the <unk> and also how the game requires trust and integrating <unk> and at the same time is of the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt many ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with <unk> water.
I think, like that, sometimes we play themselves, and explore the boundaries of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of the realization that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret to our future, a future that we need to adapt to a increasingly difficult world with greater and more difficult cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our adaptation.
To adapt to a world that changes have to play.
But let's take the peak of our game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For bonobos and human beings in the way, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems like the least appropriate play, it can be the moments that it is most <unk>
So fellow primates, let's accept this gift of evolution and <unk> together as we <unk> creativity, the friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York City, I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting the poverty, <unk> fires as a captain of a captain of a fire <unk> volunteers.
And in our city, where volunteers classify a highly skilled staff to get to the fire site very soon to go into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so he had a pretty high probability of go.
But there was still a race to the other volunteers to reach the captain in charge and figure out what our task was.
When I found the <unk> I was focusing on a conversation with the owner of the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at full night, and she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got before I had before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> --  first to the captain to the captain of the owner and he asked him to walk into the owner of your owner at the house.
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There he was a lawyer or a <unk> of money who, for the rest of his life, would have to tell people that I entered a building on flames to save a live living and just beat me for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to get to the house.
I need you to <unk> the fire, and I get this woman a couple of <unk>
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, country to the fire department -- that height and less had finished off the fire and walked into the fourth one in search for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my payload back to the staircase where I met my <unk> and the wonderful dog in the front door.
<unk> out of the house <unk> for your home home where, as he would expect, their treasure. received a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from your owner of the <unk> home and the brave effort to save her home.
The kindness that she watched for the other was that someone had reached a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> like in my calling to volunteer to be witnessed by acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also the acts of <unk> and courage on the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have achieved, or are there for me, remarkable levels of success I would like to remind you about this: not wait.
Don't wait for the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, it is right now.
We ate food in a dining room, <unk> a neighborhood park.
Are you mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone else's life, but every day we're going to be able to influence someone.
So I trained to <unk> <unk> shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block of the picture.
The first concrete blocks were built in <unk> with a very simple idea, cement modules of a fixed measure that fits themselves.
Very quickly, these became the most effective building unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things larger than us, like buildings or bridges a brick at a time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> came up with this.
It was called <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, <unk> bricks came to every home.
It's been estimated that they have been made over 400 billion or 75 billion or 75 billion or 75 billion of them on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful buildings or <unk>
It made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of <unk> <unk> stacked on a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block the transistor allows you to create much greater and more complex circuits a brick at a time.
But there's a <unk> difference. The transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't know that the building blocks of our time are reserved at the experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing the engineers into the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound and sensors.
And the best thing about it is they come together with magnets.
So you can't place the wrong way.
The bricks have a colors.
The green is the <unk> the blue is the stream, the rose is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So you just have to assemble one blue with a green one, and very quickly you can start making bigger circuits.
A blue blue with one green produce light.
We can put a button in the middle and we have a <unk>
If we change the button by a pulse, and that's here, and now we have a light module.
We had this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, it's actually very powerful.
Instead of having to connect and connect and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make <unk> faster or slower <unk> just turning this button to make the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing collection.
We want all of the interactions in the world to <unk> building ready to use.
<unk> sounds, <unk> <unk> <unk> everything has to be accessible.
We have given the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an amazing experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
So for example, how a light works, or why the door of an elevator is kept open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers without any experience in electronics begin to play with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with bottles of paper and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
A few weeks ago, a few weeks ago, we took the designers from the Rhode Island School of Rhode Island who has no experience in engineering, just in wood and paper and said, "You get something.
Here's an example of a project that you've done, an <unk> <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk> which is afraid of darkness.
For these no engineers, <unk> became another material, the electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be at all of us.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, you download all of the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of <unk> inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interaction world is us.
So let's go ahead and make things.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is looking for getting involved in the environment.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can keep the video on one side to one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I was that time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represent almost everything that we are supposed to work on the government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and they would be like some Peace <unk> for <unk>
You know, some members of the year and we put them working with the <unk>
Instead of the Third World we send them to the wild World <unk>
They made great <unk> they worked with the <unk>
Your task is to show the possibilities of current technology.
Meet <unk>
This is a hydrant in Boston.
Here it appears as if I would find a quote, but what really seeks is that somebody else is going to be caught by snow, because it knows it's not very good by turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did he get to ask for help in this way that <unk>
Last year in Boston, we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment that was very much last year.
They realized that the city never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed one more more than the citizens of <unk> with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can adopt a <unk>
You carry <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case, put it <unk>
If you don't do it, someone can <unk>
I mean, it has a compound component.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 applications that are built last year.
But it does something that any other technology of the government <unk>
And it extends viral.
A responsible system is responsible for the city of <unk> to see this app realized that he could use it, not for snow, but for citizens to take <unk>
It's very important that they work for these <unk> of tsunami, but people steal the batteries.
That's why citizens asked the <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago is just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks up when they were born.
So now we know about nine cities that plan use it.
And this has been spreading without <unk> as natural and natural way.
If you know a little government technology, you know this is not normally happening.
The acquisition of software usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston, we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to be able to choose the best public school for their children.
Then we were told that they had done by normal channels would have taken at least two and two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the inner power of California that until the time has two billion dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this on every level of government.
So an app that comes in a couple of days and it spreads into viral is a kind of warning shot in the institution of the government.
It proposes the best ways to work, not as in private companies, as a lot of people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but as well as the Internet itself.
I mean, without constraints, in a open and <unk> fashion.
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution, but as a collective action problem.
And that's really good because it turns out that we are very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools that are building together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to <unk> apps every day in their own communities.
They have not given up with the government.
Do you feel a great frustration before that, but they don't get <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost in sight.
And that is that if we left the feelings about politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that make us nuts -- the government is, essentially, in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because they alone don't <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to <unk> because things are changing.
Politics is not <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately <unk> -- remember that <unk> <unk> the way we think about it will affect the way that the change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that government is mostly about <unk>
This is the middle of <unk> and information center.
It's the place that actually serves the calls if you mark 311 in America.
Scott <unk> this call.
<unk> <unk> on the official knowledge base.
I didn't find nothing. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open my house door and put music right and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So it worked.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has a <unk> application, called <unk> <unk>
They don't <unk> that application.
It was the work of very smart people from the Bureau of New York City <unk>
One day, this really happened to get this <unk> <unk> in my Rubik's cube. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do <unk>
The <unk> dynamic is different.
Scott was speaking in person.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so you all can see this.
In this case, it saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I approached the <unk> I found the garbage garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
And I went home. I went home.
Good night sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and physical.
And it's also a great example of the income of government to collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of technological platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to go and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
It connected to the two people.
And it might have connected to the government services of being needed, but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than the government services.
When one neighbor helps each other, <unk> the communities.
If we call the animal control, it costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
So a lot of people are doing it, but they think you're the input from the other.
That our input system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that the government will transform our values and <unk> our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface surface of it.
That's why it's what we call <unk>
And we say that word <unk>
But it's that <unk> which holds us out of that that is belongs to us that we funded as something that is operating on our against, that else, and we are losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work we'll have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because it's where the real government work.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
They have <unk>
It's a group of citizens worried that they have written a very detailed report on <unk> pages in response to the order of <unk> <unk> about the financial reform.
That's not political activism -- it's a activism <unk>
And so for the ones we have faced with the government, it's time to ask us what world we want to leave with our children.
You have to see huge challenges that they will have to have to face.
They really believe that we will get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on <unk>
We can't do without government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the root function of the government so that it can be able to be able to spread out to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not that difficult to act <unk> just to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I am a greater generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to <unk> they're all going to talk.
They can express your opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when you face the government problem, they don't care about making your voices.
They're using your hands.
They bring the work to work to program apps that will work better for the government.
And those applications allow us to use their hands to improve our communities.
It can be wiping out a fire hydrant, taking away a garbage garbage that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we could always have <unk> those <unk> and a lot of people do.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not just consumers, not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and get services.
We are more than that; we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't have the citizen <unk>
So I want to ask everyone here, when it comes to the important things that we need to do together, all together, we will be a crowd of voices, or we will also be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, and in death row.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'm here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that you say here is impact around the world.
And sometimes, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have any other way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we have seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can have a lot of sense, but if they're taught with feeling, they can have a special meaning to it.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can get much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this at the practice of the law, my job.
I learned that from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard -- it was strong, it was <unk>
It was the last word in the entire family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born over the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way he saw the world.
She was <unk> but it was also <unk>
When I was small and looked at it, she was approaching me and gave me a good <unk>
I was so hard that I could barely breathe and then I got up.
One or two hours later, I came back to <unk> he was approaching me and said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I said no, I got back again and if I said yes, I was leaving me in peace.
He had this human quality that would always want to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the youngest of 10.
In occasion, when I was going to spend a time with it, it was not easy to capture their time and their attention.
My cousins were running around.
I remember when I was eight to nine years, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first I thought it was a game.
And then I looked at it, and she smiles but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, went through the room, and she took my hand and said, "Come on. The two are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say <unk>
I said, "It's okay, <unk>
She said, "Now you know, <unk> I didn't <unk> I said, "Sure."
And then I sat down, and he said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And I said, "I think you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you <unk>
I'll never forget it.
And then he said to me, "Just want me to do three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell me is you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> it always <unk>
As I <unk> my mother, I said, "Yes, <unk> I'll do that."
And then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to ask me, is that you are always going to do the right thing, but the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> I'll do it."
Then he finally said, "The third thing I want you to get to me is you never <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> I'll do that."
I grew up in the field in South <unk> I have a brother a year older and a smaller year.
When I was 14  15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> gave us my sister and me and we went to the forest.
We just get the <unk> of the usual <unk>
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. Okay.
My brother said, <unk> today <unk> And you always do the same thing as us.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good.
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
And I stood up with my gaze with strength and said, "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this is a <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this to be a <unk> I say it for the power of identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to others that don't really make sense.
We can't get them to do things that don't believe to be done.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner for the <unk>
They died of age-related disease?
And these were the things that we had to do with it, according to it.
Now, try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different today than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In the U.S. we have the largest incarceration rate in the United States.
We have seven million people on parole.
And this massive <unk> in my opinion, has changed fundamentally our world.
In poor communities or black and it's so much <unk> so much <unk> by these facts.
One of three black men between the 18 and the 30 years is at jail or a parole.
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Washington, in 50 to 60 percent of all young color young men are in prison, or on parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that makes you much better if you're rich and guilty, than if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> it's wealth that defines the results.
And it seems that we feel very <unk>
So the politics of fear and anger makes us believe that these are not really problems.
We are <unk>
I think it looks interesting.
We're looking at our work in some good <unk>
In my state, in Alabama, as in other states, you care about rights for always if you have an criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black population has lost the right to the vote.
And if we projected it to the next 10 years the level of rights loss will be as high as it was before we had the law of law to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where they were about 13 years sentence to die in prison.
We have in this country prison for kids, without a chance to come in.
Right now, we're in a process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They go to people in the death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In some sense, you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for <unk> crimes -- but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty penalty is defined by error.
From every nine <unk> people have identified an innocent one who is innocent and killed from death row.
A rate of error, they will be an innocent one in nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it wouldn't be allowed to be able to never fly airplanes if in every nine that you would die, you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our burden.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students on <unk> I talk about slavery.
I talk to you about terrorism, the time it started at the end of the reconstruction and the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a little bit defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid of being <unk>
He worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what defined his lives.
Now there are a few older people who come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you tells me, <unk> <unk> to the people who stop saying that in our own experiment for the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with <unk> and decades of <unk> and <unk> and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And this is why we haven't understood what we've ever done.
All of the time you have to do with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome the <unk> <unk> without a commitment to the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany to be conferences on death abuse.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know that it's pretty disturbing to listen to what I <unk>
<unk> We don't have death pity in Germany.
We can never get it here."
The room was quiet and a lady said, "There's no way that we have our story, we can never get into systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> <unk> and <unk> we put them to <unk>
Tell them about this.
How do we feel like a nation where a nation like Germany, would be <unk> especially if they were in their most <unk>
We couldn't do it <unk>
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these very difficult, the positive things and wonderful things are <unk>
We love innovation.
We love technology to <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment. We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are driven by suffering, the abuse, the <unk> the <unk>
In my view, we need to integrate these two things.
lately we talked about the need to have more hope, greater commitment, more commitment to the basic challenges of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the ones that never will come to TED.
If you think of it in a way, something that's inside our being.
We have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so committed to the intellectual thing.
This is innovation, the development comes not just about brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas, also by the <unk>
This connection of your mind with the heart is what drives us not just the brilliant and <unk> but also the dark and the difficult.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering from <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will to be in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think even in communities like TED, it must be <unk>
There is no related disconnect with technology and design, which will allow us to be truly humans if we don't pay due to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make up a much more challenging identity than if we are ignoring these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, and I was a very young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were just gathered to speak.
Occasionally, Mrs. <unk> was called to tell me, <unk> comes the lady <unk> We're going to get together to speak.
You want to come and <unk>
I would say, "Yes, lady. I do."
So she would say, "Well what are you going to do when I <unk>
I read him <unk>
So I went out and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mrs. <unk> went to me and said, "Now, <unk> me to tell me that this idea of <unk> justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed to help them.
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in criminal justice administration.
We try to end up with the baby sentences for life, without free freedom for children.
We try to do something about the death penalty set.
We try to reduce the population in jail.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech and he looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And they would say, <unk> out of <unk>
At that time, Mrs. <unk> got my finger on the face and said, "It's why you have to be very much, but very <unk>
I think the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We have to find the way to deal with those challenges, that problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I have come to understand and believe that each one of us is higher than the worst we have to do.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie. It's not because it's a <unk>
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not a <unk>
Even, if someone kills another, it's not a <unk>
So I think there's a basic dignity in the people that should be <unk> by the law.
I also think that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
It isn't.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think even though it's very beautiful, very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> it doesn't have to judge our technology, by our design, not for our intellectual capacity or rational.
At the end of the society, the character of a society, not the way they treat rich and powerful ones, but by the way they treat the poor, the people are <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I make too much force.
<unk> tired of all of us.
Sometimes those ideas are going beyond my presenting in a major way.
I've been representing these kids who have been convicted of a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my <unk> <unk> <unk> and 14 years -- that have been <unk> so they were <unk> as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone into what isn't it?
The judge was <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
I was a very late night and I was awake <unk> God, if the judge can turn you into something that you don't, you must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for that.
As a very evening, I couldn't think of correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a client in 14 years, a small, white.
I started to work in <unk> with a <unk> saying, <unk> for my <unk> black customer is treated like a <unk> white <unk> executive from a <unk>
In <unk> I put there there have been a <unk> behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a line on how this country is not ethical but a whole lack of ethics.
On the next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream or really <unk>
For my horror, not only had it <unk> she had sent it to court.
It was about two months, I had forgotten it.
And I finally said, "Oh my God, I have to go to court for this case stupid.
I got into the car and I felt really <unk> <unk>
I went into the <unk>
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
Finally I got down the car. I went to court.
I was going up the stairs when I came up with a black man -- was the <unk> of court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's you <unk> I said yes.
And then they were <unk> and <unk>
And I get stuck in the ear, and they heard me.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That connected to my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the <unk>
In the inside, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this <unk> <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> And we started walking.
People started to get there. They were all <unk>
I was that I had written these crazy things.
They got the policemen the prosecutors <unk> the <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people. Everyone was mad because we talked about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With my eye <unk> I got to see the <unk> which was going to be <unk>
And you would look out the window, and you would try to hear all that <unk>
It keeps walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black black, with a concern, he walked into the room and sat behind me, almost on the <unk>
About 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> <unk> showed because the <unk> had entered in the room.
The <unk> <unk> over the old black <unk>
And he said, "Well, what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black man stood up and looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and he said, <unk> to this young audience room to tell this young man who will keep her view in the target with <unk>
I've come to TED today because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds towards justice.
That we can't truly be human, if we don't care about human rights and dignity.
That our survival is tied up with each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of you who share this, I just want to tell you that they keep your view in the target with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> you hear and see an obvious desire to the audience, of this community, to help in your point of doing something.
It's something that's not a <unk> What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which you're going to make an effort to learn the funds that are now spending today in political politics.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row over the next five billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the murder cases, not <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk> don't get nowhere.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that they were <unk> these funds will make the law, the security <unk>
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in crime in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, is that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to you who you think is it?
<unk> actually, the crime rate with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's the wrong war against drugs.
That's why it emerges this dramatic increase in the population of <unk>
And we let us convince the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people into a supply chain, to steal a bicycle, for small crimes, rather than making those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our science philosophy about punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> Have you excited to be excited about here today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for coming to TED. Thank you.
Announcer: <unk> threats by Bin bin Laden.
<unk> 2: <unk> in Somalia. <unk> 3: The police shine <unk>

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months -- they could be in the last six days or for the last six days.
The idea is that the media means <unk> <unk> because our minds pay attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of each day, our senses are getting many, many more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing matter more than to survive, the first stop of all of those data is an old clip of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector, the danger.
<unk> and recorded the whole information looking for something in the environment that could do harm.
That's why a <unk> of stories would be looking at the negative.
That old saying of the <unk> "If there's blood blood, it's very true.
And since all digital devices give us negative news about seven days a week, 24 hours a day, no wonder we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going to be wrong with the worse.
But maybe not that way.
Maybe, instead, what's really happening is we get <unk>
Perhaps the huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems: climate change, the scarcity of species, the scarcity of water and <unk> no doubt we have.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and the long long we end with them.
Let's look at it in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> the average per capita adjusted per capita on inflation has been spread around the world.
Child child mortality has been reduced by 10 times.
Also, the cost of food food, of air electricity, transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve Pinker showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy went from 25 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
Many people forget.
And we continue to get higher and higher expectations.
In fact, we redefined the meaning of poverty.
<unk> in the U.S., much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, toilets, toilets, mobile phone, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> the <unk> on the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
<unk> a lot of this is the technology and lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that we had in technology of information jumps into this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the price of price in about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
That's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things at this curve.
First of all, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad times, in the war and peace, in recession <unk>
It's the outcome of rapid computers that are used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop at any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> on a law on the left, it's going up.
The growth rate of technology is actually getting faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> about Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends' friends call infinite computation and sensors, 3D printing and the ability to democratize and distribute personalized production on all of the planet, the synthetic biology, the fuels and the <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> the <unk> and the A.I. and the A.I. and the A.I. and the A.I. and the A.I. and the A.I. and the A.I. and the A.I. and
I mean, how many of you saw the victory on <unk> <unk>
It was spade.
I tried to <unk> the best headline to <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> to <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not a easy game.
We have a lot of <unk> of the human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all in your cell phone.
Four years ago, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We taught these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
We can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think of creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every <unk> on the planet, it's about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that stuff and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
Let me give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon Three in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
I went to dinner the king of <unk>
The troops of Napoleon ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with <unk>
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, the aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, which was worth more than the gold and the <unk>
That's why the tip of the Washington Washington is <unk>
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as a pure metal there.
It's tied for oxygen and <unk>
But then he came up with it, and he made the aluminum thing so cheap that we used it as if it was <unk>
We have this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet -- by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to the Earth 16 percent of energy every <unk>
It's not about fan, it's about <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than <unk> by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that in the end of the decade, in the U.S. <unk> parts of the United States, the solar power will cost six cents an hour, compared to the 15 cents of the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed at the Voyager spacecraft pointed to the Earth, in 1990, after he passed away.
<unk> a famous picture -- how do you <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent by water.
Yes, <unk> water is seawater, two percent ice, and we fought by the <unk> of the water on the planet, but there is a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes nanotechnology, the <unk>
So in a conversation with Dean Kamen -- this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you with you, he gave me permission to <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water to the day of any fresh source water, water -- controlled water, for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola just thought that I'm going to make a significant test for hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out well, and I have full confidence that this is how it will be, Coca-Cola is going to be able to implement the world in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an <unk> innovation for this technology that today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get to the 70 percent penetration of cellphones in the developing world for the end of 2013.
They took that warrior, <unk> has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya than President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell with a smartphone with Google, they have access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance and communications that nobody could have ever predicted before.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of dollars <unk> video, images, libraries of books and music technology now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing to get when it comes to health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation -- something called the X <unk> <unk> <unk> 10 million dollars.
We are challenging the teams of the world to make these technologies into a mobile device with which they speak, and because it has <unk> you can get the blood out of your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnoses than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world in which there are no doctors, where the <unk> load is 25 percent and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this device we would call a RNA virus or DNA that will not be able to call the health agency, and first of all, to stop the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it a billion in the rise.
The white lines here are the population.
We just went through the mark of seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it'll go from two billion to five billion of the Internet users.
Three billion minds have never been before the global conversation.
What would these people?
What do you do? What would you <unk>
And instead of an economic collapse, we will have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> more health thanks to the <unk> of better education with the Khan Academy of Khan and due to 3D impressions and computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we give us three billion members of humanity, healthy and <unk>
How about the voices never before before.
What if we give them to <unk> wherever they are, a voice to be heard, and be able to act for the first time?
What are these 3,000 billion?
And if they are contributions we can't afford it.
One thing that I learned from the X Prize, is that teams small, guided by their passion with an objective of course, can do things that were things that could only do the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to finish by sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game in which people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
The folds determine the structure and the functionality.
It's something very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a <unk> problem.
I've played this college professors among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined and started <unk>
And it has been shown that today the recognition of human patterns is better <unk> proteins than best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power as people to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the innovative passion of <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that are <unk> to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have in front of a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they thought I was a kid, but it wasn't like that.
They actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as a very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is at the Red <unk> <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures are still saying they are still <unk>
So what about here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a <unk> in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned so much with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The <unk> was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, from some <unk>
There were <unk> from about 20 seconds, a black beard, <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good time, so he made more than half the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the number of fish had dropped in half.
I would go back to the five inches.
It <unk> a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In some ways, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> fishery in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s -- well, it started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was imposing in countries that had already 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty <unk> was called the <unk> four.
I went out to fish in it, and we did studies in the South China Sea, and above all, in the <unk> Sea.
What we captured there was a <unk> thing.
<unk> now -- the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are blobs of tiny spots on some of the problems that are fish of coral reefs.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In one year, you do a study and then it starts commercial fishing.
The background goes from being a solid coral background in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not the <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
He once captured a alive.
It was still not <unk>
So they wanted to get it out, because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains that they collect the fishermen every time they go to a zone that have never been fish.
But there's no <unk>
We don't remember the world, but we don't remember it.
<unk> the start point of start at a new level, without remembering what was there.
If you take this something like this.
On the <unk> we have things that are <unk> number of <unk> <unk> the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation using the images received at the beginning of their conscious life as normal, and extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can look at the succession of change.
And at the end to keep a few <unk> <unk>
And that, really, is we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies -- killing animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very plentiful, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose <unk> animals.
Even if this doesn't look like a great loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a sea synonymous with big fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
Over time there are a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know that it was different.
In fact, many people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because evidence presented in an earlier way, is not the way they would expect the evidence.
So for example, the anecdote that some of the <unk> just like Captain such as a lot of fish in this area cannot be used or generally they don't use the scientists of the fishery, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in <unk> societies because they don't trust the sources of the past.
From there the huge role that can make a protected marine zone.
Because with the marine areas, we really recreated the past.
We have the past that people can't think of because the starting point has been run and is very low.
That's for the people that you can see a marine marine protected area and can benefit from the vision that you can erase their point of <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they have no access, like the people in the West, for example?
I believe that the arts and cinema may be able to fill in the vacuum.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in Chesapeake Bay for 500 years.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about it, if you think about what people were touched with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why do we <unk> with the <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a certain sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, is to Cameron, make <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and I look at YouTube videos in a professional form.
It's true.
So today we're going to see why the videos are <unk> and how important it has to have that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when I was younger, that seemed very, very difficult.
But today, the website makes any of us, or from our actions, copper <unk> in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be done famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They climb over 48 hours of video to YouTube for a minute.
And of course, just a small percentage of these, is getting lots of visits and gained cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: <unk> communities of participation and <unk>
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
My God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video shot outside his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the <unk> <unk> last summer.
<unk> was not proposed to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow. I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I'd already published a lot of videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that I would send to the <unk>
The trends of trends like Jimmy <unk> present things and interesting and <unk> to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, Friday. You have to start on a Friday.   You all want you to come up with the end of the week, the weekend.   <unk> Friday. <unk> on a Friday.  KA: Don't think that we can have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
Rebecca <unk> Rebecca Black is one of the most popular videos.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have emerged from nowhere.
So what did this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they're also Friday.
But what did this day, this particular Friday did.
Well, the <unk> <unk> and many blogs started to write about it.
Michael J. <unk> <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to make a joke about video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a consumer group will take a point of view, and they share with a larger audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who share this great inner joke then start talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> of <unk> on YouTube.
Only in the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the 20th entertainment entertainment century, this community participation is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an <unk> animation with a <unk> music.
So that's it.
This year, they saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there's a <unk> version of the time you've seen four million times.
Even cats saw this video.
And there are cats who saw other cats seeing the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity I woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Someone made an version of the old one.
And then it became international made.
Suddenly, it came a whole community of <unk> which made this happen to be a dumb joke to something that we can all become part of.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca Black or <unk> <unk>
What script might have been written to be written by this situation?
In a world where you go up two days of video per minute, just that the only thing and unexpected can <unk> the way these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy that protest against <unk> in New York, I admit I wasn't interested in too much.
Casey <unk> I <unk> <unk> <unk> but often there are obstacles that can be able to fly properly by the <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise and his humor, Casey <unk> made it five million seeing and understood his idea.
So this approach is worth all the new things that we do in a <unk>
And all of this leads us to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of tendency, creative communities of participation, all the unexpected, are features of a new kind of media -- a new culture, where we all have access and is the audience that defines the <unk>
As I said earlier, one of the celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
Don't get permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- it's just the news features -- but we have the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the parts.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a man whose whole life had been supported in the unique hope of unity and freedom of his country.
<unk> while <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that his life had been totally <unk>
The words for so long, friends, now <unk>
You get into silence.
She died broken by the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother was never allowed to forget his story.
My task was not to let that been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but it was <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn, <unk> <unk> to the sea.
My mother, <unk> was just 18 years when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been meant to a task that was given to escape his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her who couldn't do it.
And then from a <unk> <unk> that defies fiction, a boat swims into the sea dressed up to the sea dressed up.
All the adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was the innovators and rape and death.
As most of the adults, my mother had been wearing a poison.
If we were to first -- we would take it my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the motor, the <unk> diving in every single <unk> and the vast and empty horizon and vacuum.
I don't remember the hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the bravery of men on our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to start for six hours.
But I know the lights in the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, to finish the journey was too much to it; and the first apple that I tried to, because of the men on the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, it was in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations giving a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> whose population is made of immigrants in a <unk>
Unlike the middle suburbs of middle class, whose existence <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English English snippets were being among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a <unk> assembly line, working six days, <unk>
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in I.T. <unk> from the <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and established an extra mentoring in English and mathematics, you wouldn't mind what it was <unk> which was always <unk> <unk> always <unk>
Two base pairs for school, one to hide the holes on the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because it had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> back again.
At home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were amazed on our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at home.
My mother had <unk> all of the ship.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares started to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And the women came with their stories about men who couldn't make their <unk> angry and <unk> boys and <unk> <unk>
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they were created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, I was a classic classical student, relentless with what I <unk> of myself.
On the other, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically, by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many of them got help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year, I was elected by the Australian girl in the year.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges of it not <unk>
As <unk> <unk> anonymously in <unk> was now <unk> refugee and social activist invited to speak in sites that had never heard of, and in houses whose existence would have never imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat to the <unk> and the comfort of life in a particular suburb -- a <unk> a mother and two daughters ending the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of every single one and walking <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom who couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age as she had when we got the boat.
It wasn't a choice.
<unk> said to me, "What are you not <unk>
So I talked about <unk> juvenile and education and <unk> and <unk>
And the more frankly I was talking about, the more it was <unk> to speak.
I met people from all the paths of life, many of them doing what they were living on the border of possible.
And although I ended up my working, I realized I couldn't stay in a career of law.
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's well going to be a stranger, a new way, on the scene -- and not only it's good, but that's why I'm grateful, maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> the <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps outside of my comfort zone to know that, yes, that the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was a energy there, an optimism <unk> a rare mix of humility and courage.
So I kept following my intuition.
I put a little group of people out of the people who motto can't <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, it made a giant pot of soup that all <unk>
They go back to night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant ones and we opened us up.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
After a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure adventure.
Before I finish, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up at a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother was raised alone.
At 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support from his husband, caused a <unk> to the <unk> and bringing the cause and she was a lot more <unk> caused when I won.
It can't be proved to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the room in <unk> when she died, 1,000 miles in <unk>
I looked at the <unk> of the shower and saw her standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell the stories and we make sure we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us that he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body is so <unk>
"Because you've taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You don't have <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Because of those who were and how life we were going to do now we can see that the men who have reached our lives would have <unk> us.
The defeat would be easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who might want that to know?
I fear the privilege of the easy to the right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, just diving courageous at each <unk> the <unk> rate of motor, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could take it and see sure you would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of how it's here today in the fourth or fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the singer <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the old Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel to a car and drop the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time when I was born, the great prince warrior Indian warrior -- he was <unk> getting a bow and a <unk> on the ground, he got water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was really excited about that.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I had this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't afford my friends.
I thought that technology had to allow the magic, not kill her.
As a girl my grandfather gave me his <unk> <unk>
And this piece of <unk> technology was for my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of <unk> and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile phone, the <unk> <unk> and the cameras prevent them from <unk>
Show our inspiration.
And so I was struck by this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, rather than her.
I was born books from 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a narrative device able to connect the readers of the entire world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are.
It will bring text with the image, animation, sound and touch.
The storytelling becomes increasingly <unk>
But what does that do for us?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so this --  -- he says, "This box belongs <unk> I write my name.
And so I come back a character from the book.
At various times, I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- that comes led to me.
My inner girl gets excited with all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean wizards and <unk> but to that magic magic of childhood, those ideas that we have.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always exciting to me.
So over here, we have to raise the iPad to release fireflies.
And, really, they light your way into what subtraction of the book.
Another idea that fascinated me as a little bit of girl was that a whole galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world is transformed into a <unk> that I <unk> into this magical device within the device.
And this opens up a map.
In every single academic book, there has always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that goes up, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book, they also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another extraordinarily important aspect to me is to create Indian content and in the contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of the fairies and the <unk> but how many people out of India know their counterparts in India know the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and moist book.
So we're bringing them back into a child child history.
In a story that deals with current issues like environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> not left to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can bring our kids into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions in the book is this adventure where you have to go outside the outside, take the camera or iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a child I had a lot of <unk> of <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason children don't do it.
So in order to recover this childhood ritual you have to go out and in a chapter, I would take a picture to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So it creates a digital collection of photos that then you can put on the Web.
A kid from London puts a picture of a <unk> and says, "Oh, today I saw a <unk>
A child from India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Within the variations of connection between the magic, the Earth and technology are so many possibilities.
In the next book, we have to have an interaction where you come out with the iPad and the video on and through augmented reality by looking at a bunch of cartoons that appear on the inside of the house.
At a moment, the screen is full of leaves here.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> so you can read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world in which the forces of nature are embedded with technology and magic and technology is closer to another.
It removes the energy of the sun.
We are approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that we just sat through a simple story.
Thank you.
I want to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> at a director of the listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk> What's wrong with me.
How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of us, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale -- it's a very simple thing.
It has a <unk> on and closed up.
Every morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got a challenge to get to 95 percent.
But it is so simple, that every time I get down to me sends my data to Google <unk>
And my doctor from <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my problem is, of weight, not at the same time where it needs assistance or some urgency of that style, but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect me to my Wi-Fi scale and before I get up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some activity of <unk> to have more control over their health.
From the next week I'll be available from the next week to be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people were hanging out from their homes, taking their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor, and share it with each other, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, return to <unk> and to be launched by their own <unk> but it also can help us care about health care because of the challenges that we face as the cost of the care costs of attention and other issues.
We have techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like these, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did want to share with you with a video video.
We all have checks from navigation in the <unk>
Maybe we even have them on our cell phones.
We know exactly where ATMs <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food.
But where is the nearest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked but no one <unk>
No one knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was we made <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public public, you see a <unk> by favor of <unk> <unk> where, and when it's open, because they sometimes open up in <unk> in the office and others are closed.
And more than 10,000 people are introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we did an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time they are in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> you can use your iPhone, and then the next weeks to use their cell phone from Microsoft to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we want to take a global <unk>
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, at other universities, to help us find and work like a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
And also, I'd like to invite companies around the world that could help us solve these <unk>
You could be services or <unk> or <unk> people for example, to see if the <unk> which is shown in their place.
Please forgive me in this and not only improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're pictures that can't take with their cameras.
My interest by photography came up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
I mixed with my previous passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because when I used the camera the process was in my planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when the <unk> is <unk>
For me, photography had more to do with being on the right place, at the right time.
I thought anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start the press <unk>
And you know, <unk> like this: a very <unk> road.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And despite it, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or photos like <unk> dark <unk> and parallel at once, but with the common objective of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say <unk> I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something I can do, but I always want it to seem to be captured in a way as photography.
I mean, you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to capture an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what's the trick that makes it seem real <unk>
Is it the details or the <unk>
<unk> light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end this is about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here are three things that are perfectly <unk> something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some ways they can create something that still seems like <unk> as if I was.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So let's take the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it really doesn't make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's actually combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture seem to be realistic I think they're those in which they don't even <unk> the things around us in our everyday life.
But by combining photographs is very important, because otherwise something looks wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to make realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But they can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the pictures -- they must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet with these <unk> they were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make you impossible to distinguish the principle and the end of the different images with a perfect union group.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
So you might think this is the picture of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is totally composed by photographs of different places.
In the staff I think it's easier to create a place that we found because you don't need to be endangered the ideas that has in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in winter knew that I had several months to try and find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a <unk> well.
And yes, I even made a red house at the top of the island to look more <unk>
So in order to achieve a realistic outcome. I think we need planning.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then we have to combine the different photographs.
And here each piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the photos the result can be very beautiful and then a very realistic time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing you a slide about technology, very boring.
Please, if you can <unk>
It's a diagram that I took from a folder for me.
I'm not interested in showing you the details -- but the general aspect of it.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of the local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, like a lot of others that we usually see, is a kind of a straight line at scale.
In other words, each step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves is new.
So here's something strange.
And that's what I'm just going to talk about.
Please light up the lights.
It gets more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do we make technology curves at <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw them into a normal curve in which, say, these are the years, or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to look at -- the diagram would look ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say a lot.
But if you ask yourself, for example, some other technology, like transportation, a curved curve would be very <unk> we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, you have a <unk> change.
If the technology of the transport technology is as fast as <unk> in the past morning, we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But don't go to that rhythm.
There's no precedent in the history of technological development that every few years of magnitude.
The question I want to ask is -- look at these curves <unk> we see that they don't keep forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
It was one of two things.
Or it's going to become a typical curve -- I know how to come up with something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask me, is, what is that new shape that you adopt the world?
What new state is in the world?
The transition seems very, very confused if we're engaged in it.
I remember a child in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see the future is still 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is going on.
It happens a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because it all will be so different to extrapolate about what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how it might be that transition to <unk>
But to do that I'll have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and looking at things in the long term.
The time scale that I'd like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this picture makes sense if we look at each billion years.
So you go back about two and two billion years when the Earth was a big sterile rock with many chemicals that were going around it.
If we look at the way those chemicals organized that, we give us a sense of how things came from.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at that time, there were all sorts of oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes inside its inside.
Some of those oil drops there was a particular combination of chemicals that they made them bring out of the outer materials from the outside and so the drops grew up.
And they started divide.
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell shapes -- these <unk> of oil.
But those drops weren't alive in the current sense, because each of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time you <unk> it is a separate distribution of the chemicals that we have.
So every droplet was a little bit different.
In fact, the droplets that somehow become better at the time to incorporate the <unk> chemicals -- more <unk> more chemists and get more <unk>
They usually lived longer. They were more <unk>
It was a way of life, and it was very simple, but things got interesting to you, when these drops learned the <unk> trick.
In some way that we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to store information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this sort of sense, a writing system that allowed them to register what was to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living self is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just <unk> now we can write things with this code.
So here I have a hundred <unk> of white dust that I'm trying to hide at the safety of security.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the ordinary letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and <unk> 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants to be 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have many for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and it would have <unk> over the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made this cells happy, another billion years ago.
But then another big step happened in which things got very different and that was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information forming and communicating information in this way of cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
In that way, for example, it evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and the <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication led to be communities who, in a way, were together in it, and a set of <unk>
So it <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals in that community to become more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came over so much that they came together and decided to write all the recipe from the community together in a DNA chain.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities that are <unk> communities of many different types of cells working together as one organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or the muscle cell or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels of cell phone, which we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
And these started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't make more than processing information in community.
They're <unk> structures.
The neurons are the <unk> devices that process the information that those microbial cell communities.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being responsible <unk> structures and understanding the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system in those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the time of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learn how to eat certain fruit, because I knew bad and sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism since they had built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit of them.
So the fact that the nervous system built these data structures accelerated enormously the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time that we need to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the <unk> version that we know is human language.
If you think about it, it's an amazing invention.
I have a very complicated idea of a <unk> idea.
I'm here sitting emitting some <unk> and hopefully building a similar and vague idea, and <unk> in their heads that holds some analogy with mine.
But we take a very complicated thing that we turned it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started to do abstractions.
We now spend through periods similar to organisms that are <unk> our funding methods and <unk> <unk>
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> the <unk> the video tape, <unk> and so forth, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we do before.
Now evolution can happen in <unk>
You already saw the evolutionary <unk> in which he produced some evolution with the <unk> program.
And now we've accelerated the scales over time again.
The first stages of the story that told them took a billion years of each other.
The next few stages, the nervous system and the brain, took about hundreds of millions of years.
The closer, the language and so on, they took less than a million years.
And as long as electronics, it seems to take just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something which accelerates its own pace of change.
The more changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that employment for <unk> would not be possible without the <unk> <unk>
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to be <unk>
I don't know that every transistor in that machine connections.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think of a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine and the machine with that something that makes something that it wasn't possible, get far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes it uses methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method I've been using lately, is the evolution itself.
So we put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the <unk>
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve.
So we say, "Please a hundred million of the instructions for chance?
You could run these instructions at random, at random, to run all those programs, and take those that are more <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
So let's say I want to tidy up, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to setting up numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did it.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random footage that better did the <unk>
They get those and <unk> the rest.
And now we <unk> the <unk> the numbers.
And we went back to <unk> following a process of analog <unk> analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, that <unk> <unk> and the children will be able to get the properties of both of these programs.
So we got a new generation of product programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Let's go back again.
We were making some mutations going on.
And it tries again and <unk> with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can make the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or a few complicated, in a few hours.
At the end, we ended up with programs that are taking numbers of absolutely perfect.
In fact, it's a lot more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to ask them to see how they work.
They're kind of weird programs.
But they get the <unk>
In fact, I do it, I have the safety of the goal that you get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that we succeeded.
In fact, their lives depend on it.
I once went in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he pulled out a card and he says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> that work together to offer a <unk> flight, don't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we began to depend on computers to make very different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering means.
However, we don't understand all the choices that you are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
We now use those programs to make computers much faster and then be able to run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, it was <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we are at an analog time to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the turning point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant from our part to think that we are the ultimate product of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of the creation of whatever it is.
But now it comes lunch and I think I'll stop here before I <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that must change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent time enough to allow me to cede part of my false <unk>
Before I treat my talk, let's talk a little baseball issue.
Why not?
We're close to the end of the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of the <unk> <unk> talks about statistics and using them to form a big baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you know.
It's called the average <unk>
And we talked about 300 percent of a <unk> that <unk> 300.
That means the bat <unk> <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to throw the ball into the game of the game without being <unk> and that anyone who tries to <unk> to the first base, not for time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how a <unk> <unk> call <unk>
Well, actually, well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how to call a baseball <unk> of <unk>
By the way, that's somebody that 10 <unk> hit four.
<unk> like legendary Ted Williams, the last player in the League of.
Now I <unk> this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and you have a surgeon who has also a record of 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a place from remote and a dear to have two clogged arteries and their family doctor is derived from a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is 200 <unk>
But you know what?
She is improving this year.
And the hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I will ask:
What do you believe that you should be the average of a heart surgeon or a <unk> or a nurse or a <unk>
1,000, very well.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in all medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is <unk> the world, and me included, with the <unk>
That never, ever made a mistake and <unk> to figure out how to do it right.
That was the message that I had when I was in medical school.
I was an eternal student.
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman <unk> studied until a blood test.
Such true.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the residence of nurses at the General General Hospital in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my kind of <unk> <unk> where the origin and the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or frequent <unk>
And I even knew the biological diagnosis of how they classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> of the school of medicine with the impression that if you were -- everything, then it would know everything, or the most possible, close to everything, because I would get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a university hospital here, in Toronto when they brought the lady to the emergency emergency service where I worked.
I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when I applied to a cardiologist I applied to a cardiologist to go to that patient.
It will report to the head of residents.
When I saw Mrs. <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, what it brought to me a heart failure failure.
In these conditions the heart stops working and instead of pump your blood forward, the blood goes to our lungs, these are <unk> and so there's a difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I went to work on the treatment that I would tell you.
I gave him <unk> and medication to ease the pressure in his heart.
I gave him <unk> water pills so that I could eliminate liquid.
And in one hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more errors.
He sent her home without talking to the boss of residents.
I didn't pick up the phone and I did what I should have done, I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen, he would have been able to bring <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to make constant care.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that could take care of my patients without even contact with my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When he sent her home, I didn't recognize a voice to a voice on my inside that he would say, <unk> it's not a good idea.
In fact, I was so insecure that I was asking the nurse that she would go to the woman who was beaten up to the <unk> <unk> who is okay if he goes to her <unk>
And the nurse thought and then he said to complete <unk> "Yeah, I think I'll be okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So it was signed up, and the ambulance with the ambulance and the ambulance took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in your stomach.
But I followed my job.
At the end of the day, I was <unk> to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was in my home and I did something that I don't do normally, I don't do normally, I don't do normally, I don't do galaxies.
It happened by the emergency emergency service service service.
And there was another nurse, not the one I was born from the lady <unk> before, but another one, he told me three words, those three words that most of the emergency doctors.
Other specialists are afraid of it, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and that is that we see <unk> patients.
The three words is: Is you?
He remembers the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, "Well she <unk> with the same tone <unk>
She was fine.
But I went back and on the verge of death.
After an hour of having come to his house, after I gave him the high and he had a collapse and her family called the <unk> the <unk> brought her to emergency pressure with a <unk> blood pressure of <unk> which means a shock <unk>
I just barely breathe and it was blue.
The emergency personnel <unk> all their resources.
They gave him medication to raise blood pressure.
He got a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care therapy and waiting for all of the hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days later, it was obvious that they never did.
He had a permanent brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> what was happening.
And the ninth day, she was left to go. Mrs. <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they don't forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
The weeks later, I was passionate about it, and I experienced it for the first time <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt alone, isolated without feeling that healthy shame because you can't stand up with your colleagues.
You make the peace and never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame that I talk about is the one that makes us feel very bad about it.
It tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we are bad.
And that felt.
And it wasn't because of my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure I would take the things and made sure that I didn't get <unk>
And I kept getting those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why did he send her home?
And in my worst <unk> Why made I made a mistake so <unk>
Why do I choose medicine?
Little to that feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And on one day, he opened the sky and finally left the sky, and I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with me in which if you were going to get the efforts to be perfect for not making more mistakes, I would make up those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
It went back again.
Two years later, I was in the emergency department in a hospital hospital in a north of Toronto, and I got a <unk> man.
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I watched her because I was a little bit <unk>
He sent him to penicillin and he sent him home.
But while he was headed to the door he kept pointing his throat.
Two days later, when I came to do my guard, my boss asked to talk to me in his office.
And he gave the three words: <unk>
Remember the patient who saw a pain in the <unk>
He came back and he didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially fatal condition.
You can come up with Google. It's an infection, not because of the throat, but it can cause the closing side of those tracks.
He doesn't die.
You get <unk> antibiotics on it, and you get recovered in the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back to work, until it happened again and again, and again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were committed to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of it.
And I took an X-ray of kidneys, but it turned normal. A colleague who was checking the patient perceived to be some sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner and called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read liquid order for <unk> and I asked my colleague to <unk>
I checked it and when you notice some sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner, I called a surgeon.
They were both operated and they recovered well.
But every case struck me, <unk> me.
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful have been over the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't tell you about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what's really going on, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this so that they don't make the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the errors in other doctors, but you'll never hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, as a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- believe that he would have difficulty looking at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> those who make mistakes and people who don't know that they can't sleep and the ones that I know; those who have <unk> results and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction like antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you step out of medicine to people who make mistakes, we will get a secure system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism, I've done a personal study of bad medical <unk> medical errors to learn how possible, from the first article that I wrote to the Toronto "Star to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> <unk> <unk> art.
And what I learned is that errors are <unk>
We work in a system where errors happen every single day, where one in 10 drugs are <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where violent infections are more and more, causing chaos and death.
In this country, they die 24,000 <unk> <unk>
The U.S. Institute established 100,000 dollars.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so these things are.
A <unk> system where the knowledge is multiply every two or three years, and we don't get <unk>
sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow a perfect history of a patient in the chest.
Now, let's take a look at the same patient with a chest pain. It comes <unk> with <unk> eyes and <unk> and all of a sudden, my story <unk>
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't want their symptoms always in the same way.
All of this, errors are inevitable.
So if we take the system like us and we eliminated all the professional professionals -- well, not to get anybody.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> <unk> art, it's a habit to say, "This is my worst <unk> I would say to everybody, from the <unk> to the head of surgery -- this is my worst <unk> blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. "What are your <unk> and <unk> the microphone to them.
And their students were <unk> <unk> <unk> their head and <unk> saliva and started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, they don't make a <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> <unk> is human, you know, they accept it, and they're not proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
It supports their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
They do the mistakes of other people not with intent on <unk> but in a loving way, and for support for everyone to be seen.
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm a human, <unk> mistakes.
And I feel a lot but I get to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently did a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choice that he says to pick an American American, it's about 70 to a day.
Not a lot, in a research went on for a week to a group of business presidents
The researchers recorded the different tasks for these executives and the time that we were trying to make decisions about these tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> <unk> jobs a week.
Naturally, every work included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required for an hour or more of their time.
Now think about your choices.
Do you know how many of you belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
How does the way that we deal with those <unk>
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> to choose to <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and about potential solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know their answers.
When I ask a question, as I am blind, you raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive -- please give you a <unk>
And now my first question: Are you ready to talk about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, I was going to be a very, very <unk> supermarket supermarket at least at the time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to an amusement park.
There were 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different fruits of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of the water <unk> and this was when we had the tap.
I loved going to that store, but on one occasion, I asked myself, why never bought nothing?
This is the <unk> of the olive oil.
They had over 75 different classes, including the ones that were in box <unk> that came from trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and I asked him, <unk> this strategy to offer all these <unk>
He pointed to me with the buses full of tourists that came up every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to make a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had <unk> different classes.
We had a put on the entrance to the store.
We put it out there <unk> six <unk> or 24 flavors and we look at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop trying to test it.
More people stopped when they had <unk> a 60 percent, when there were only six, 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here we found the opposite effect.
They stopped when there were only three percent to buy <unk>
If you had six, we had six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six, that if they were six.
Well, to decide that we don't buy <unk> we probably <unk> <unk> less good to preserve the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of choices is affecting us in <unk> decisions.
We decided to do not decide, even when this doesn't get to us.
Now the issue of the day, the saving financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we look at the decisions about the savings of about a million Americans, between a million Americans, in between 650 plans.
We were interested in seeing if the number of funds is available in plans for savings plans for your <unk> program <unk> people to save for the future.
And we discovered that I actually had a <unk>
We had <unk> plans to 59 different options.
We found that the number the number of fundraising funds there were less participation.
So if we look at the extreme, we see that in the plans that offer two funding, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as I wanted to.
And in the plans that offered about 60 funding, the rate of participation came from the 50th birthday.
It turns out even if you decide to participate, when there's more choices, even in that case, there is negative consequences.
So for the ones that they decided to participate, the more the number of choices, more people will be empowered to avoid actions or investment.
In terms of the more choice, they were more willing to invest in market financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are trying to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three negative negative consequences by providing more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that we make the decision, even though this is in against self-interest.
You are more likely to take the worst <unk> in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things less <unk> even though objectively they go better.
The main reason is that we have to look at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we're not able to do the calculations to make it contrast and contrast and pick that awesome <unk>
So today I want to give you four simple techniques that we've made out of one way or another, in different research, so you can test for their businesses.
The first is, <unk>
You heard before, but it's never been more true than today, that less is more.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're looking at more and more is that if you choose to cut, we get rid of getting rid of <unk> choices, there will be an increase in sales <unk> there will be a better experience in the election.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> 15, saw 10 percent increase in sales.
When the corporation <unk> <unk> all the products for <unk> of cats that are less <unk> they raised the <unk> in <unk> by two major sales and lower costs.
And you know that the supermarkets of this on average offer 45,000 products.
In a store of Walmart they offer a 100,000 products.
But the ninth store in the current world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce on it.
In the world of financial savings, I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to handle better choices is David <unk> <unk>
All the Harvard employees are automatically <unk> automatically to a insurance background.
Those people really want to choose each other, have 20 funding, not 300 or more.
You know that often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of them are <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences there are among those choices.
And if your employees can't afford it, they can't do their <unk>
This evening, before this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that it would be willing to offer people in this audience a vacation on a holiday with a vacation with everything paid the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a round of applause.
<unk> <unk> Okay, anyone who's ready to accept the deal.
They are not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You know, there was a trick.
Who's ready for that journey?
I think I really got to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information in the first <unk> than in the second, but I can tell you that the second time was more real.
Because the images made it to be more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the <unk> problem that is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of every choice, and that the consequences must feel very <unk> very concrete,
Why do people spend 15 percent more on average when they use debit cards or credit than when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out that it looks more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to <unk>
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were working on <unk> these people were at a meeting where they were being transferred to a <unk> plan.
And that meeting exactly as <unk> we made a little <unk>
What we added was that we filed the staff to think about the positive things that they would take in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the number they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put on their <unk> accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study we did in a hall of magazines.
We saw that in supermarket. It took over the <unk> <unk> the display of magazines can hold from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because the ranking tells me how to <unk>
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> Give you a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> Give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know something?
This framework is totally useless.
The categories must tell you something that we don't know the <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge <unk>
You know, I'm supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we think, if just a little bit.
We need to increase the complexity of it.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
So let's look at a <unk> decision to do a car.
This is a car manufacturer that allows us to <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions, to build the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that each one.
It's 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is change the order in which the decisions.
So half of the customers are going to go from many options, 56 colors, just a few <unk>
The other half of customers are going to go in a few options, four <unk> at 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How do you get involved.
If you are <unk> the default button in every decision, this indicates that you're <unk> or <unk> we're being lost.
We found that the ones that go from a lot of choices to few choices to make the default button again and again, and another one.
The <unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, they continue there.
Same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was <unk> the order in which information is present to you.
If we start with the easy thing, you learn to <unk>
Even though the choice of changes is not to say anything about the preferences of inner interior -- in all ways we make us a choice.
We're excited about a product that we're building that now has more engaged in the process.
So to sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> to eliminate alternate alternatives -- <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I've been presented were designed to help manage the <unk> or better for you, to use them in their own business, or for the people who will work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is to be careful the <unk>
And the more careful we are in our choices better we can practice art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1970s in Germany -- <unk> <unk> if you had a typewriter to write to the government.
You had to register a piece of text of example written with the machine.
And so the government could track the origin of the <unk>
If they were writing with the wrong message, you could track the footprint to the idea of the idea.
In the West we don't think of somebody who could do this, how much this is -- the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer of any big manufacturer of any big manufacturer and it prints a page, that page will end up having some little yellow dots printed on every page that follow a pattern that makes you own one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be very much like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If you look at what happens in the world online, we can put together the attacks of their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> <unk> is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the <unk> to make a lot of money, huge amounts.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that we would take money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, and <unk> <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys are doing their fortunes online, but they do it by illegal means by illegal means using banking in order to steal money from our accounts when we bought in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought a computer <unk>
The secret secret service was two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know your <unk>
And I say today is more likely to be a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong with the worse.
In the future, most crime crimes are online.
The second group of relying on the importance of today is not driven by the money.
There's another thing that the move, they motivate them the protests, they motivate the opinions, they motivate them laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have been <unk> in the last 12 months, occupying a prominent role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> criminals that make it for money, the <unk> as Anonymous that makes it to protest and the last group are the United States of the national <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is an authority of <unk> of the Netherlands, or, actually, it was.
<unk> the bottom last fall because of a <unk>
We took the safety of the site and they carried a <unk>
Last week I said, in a meeting with representative of the Dutch government, I asked one of the leaders if they <unk> <unk> death of people because of the attack to <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die of a heart attack.
<unk> is an <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
What are the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services -- <unk> services like <unk>
Except to make a foreign foreign authority authority.
And they were making <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt, the <unk> protesters on the secret police police in April 2011, and during the building, of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes of a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept a large scale of citizens in the country.
They had sold this tool for 280 euros to the <unk> government.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments give them tools to give government tools to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, he found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by officials of the German government to investigate their own citizens.
If you are suspicious in a criminal case, you know, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it's going beyond.
The Internet connection.
And we will find out even tools like the <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and to listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think closely about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to do it.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could rely on our governments today in 2011, any right that we will spend today, it will be forever.
<unk> <unk> in any future government, in a administration we might have within 50 years?
These are the questions that you have to worry about the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the south of Park, National Park.
These are the cows of my dad, the <unk> and behind the cows, the National Park.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences at most of the South, which means that wild animals like synapses -- migrate outside the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones they killed at night, and so soon we wake up in the morning and we found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and so we value them so much.
So I grew up with a lot of lions.
The people are dying of the warriors who protect our community and livestock and they're also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is why there are so few in Yellowstone National Park.
A child in my community, at age six, it's responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing to me happen to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought that male lions were scared.
But I realized that this is actually not <unk> because even he helped lions to see the pen <unk>
I don't get <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
She was trying to trick the lions so they believed that he was near the <unk>
But male lions are very smart --  they came on the first day and saw the <unk> and they came back and said, this stuff isn't moving, it's always here.  So jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and the lions didn't come back.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on a switch to turn the lights off.
And this is a little lamp of a <unk>
It <unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell charge the battery and the battery -- electricity to the little box <unk> I call it a transformative.
And the box <unk> makes the lights up.
As you can see, the <unk> get out there, because that's where lions.
And this is how they see lions when they come from night.
The lights were <unk> and <unk> the lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my home two years ago, and since then, we never had problems with lions.
And the houses of the neighborhood heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and male lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
The <unk> You can see the background, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community and they are serving a lot.
And my idea is also used now by all Kenya, for frightening to other predators like <unk> <unk> and it's also used to make elephants seriously <unk>
Thanks to this <unk> I was fortunate to get a scholarship to one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International College and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise funds and <unk>
I even took my friends into my community and installed lights in the houses that don't have it, and I teach them how to fix it.
So a year ago, I was just a boy on the meadows of the savanna <unk> the cows of my father, and he used to see airplanes that would be inside of one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come to TED.
My great dream is to get to be a aviation engineer, and a pilot when you grow.
And I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to hear a story about you.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working in other electrical inventions at the time.
What's the next thing in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to make a fence about electric CA: A near <unk>
<unk> I know they were already invented electric interactions, but I want to do mine.
CA: So I took it back once, right, and <unk> <unk> I've been trying before, but I had to get a <unk>  CA: Al foot. Richard <unk> are a big thing.
We go to <unk> in every step I would raise my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a small one, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would go all the time studying the history of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except for America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
Though sometimes I was asking me about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until everything changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public execution,
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister's colleague at my sister.
That was saying, "When I <unk> this -- the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're prepared to die."
It was very <unk>
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering from my country.
At the time when I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A <unk> woman was dead on the street, holding a little boy in her arms looking at his own face of his mother without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
It was a huge famine of North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and just a few survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also became more and more prevalent the energy cuts -- everything around me was completely dark at night except by the lights in the sea in China, barely crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> river that serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, they see bodies floating in the river, right?
I can't tell you the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separate from my family for a short time.
I could never have imagined that he would take 14 years to go back together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be like refugee <unk>
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but it also dangerous, because North Koreans in China were regarded as illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destination in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was made, when I was arrested by the Chinese police and I was <unk> at the police station.
Someone had been accused of being <unk> then <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end up.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the interrogation -- an official told him, "This was a <unk> She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are seeking in <unk> <unk>
But many of them can be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Even though there were <unk> they were eventually released after a hard international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> North Korea, where they are <unk> incarcerated or executed in public.
But I was fortunate to escape many other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
And even after learning a new language and finding work, all of its world can fit into a second.
That's why that, after 10 years of hiding my identity, I've decided to go on to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than expected.
English was very important in South Korea, so I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South
We're all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because 67 years of <unk>
I even went through a identity crisis.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that I could call it for me.
Even though we had the life in South Korea was not easy, I made a plan. I started studying for the test for college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had a little money that sent my family, and because my family was going to be moved into force to a location from the <unk>
They had to run away.
So I began to plan how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way toward freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korean and South Korea.
So, ironically, took a flight to China, and I was headed to the border of North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to get it in a way, for over 3,000 miles through China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we almost got caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and <unk> by an official police officer.
He asked them all of us, and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be <unk>
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, I grew up, I stood up and told him that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way up to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribing the border guards in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and imprisoned by crossing the border border.
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did everything for my family, and we were so close to my family, and we were so close to my family, but my family was <unk> in prison in the South Korea.
I was going and came in between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man said, "What's the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would love him.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I gave him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the ATM and gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans and pick them up.
I read him with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of unknown <unk> a new hope for me and for the <unk> people when I was more <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the hope that the people <unk> needs.
With the time, after our long journey, my family and I went together in South Korea, and I met in South Korea.
But achieving their freedom is just half the struggle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with some or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practical in the English language, practice practices, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people within North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us continue in contact with family still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea.
I've been very <unk> I've received a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans a chance to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans all over the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in <unk>
This is <unk> <unk> stores.
So the planners of the city came together and they thought, we're going to change the South Center for it to represent something more, so they changed the South Los Angeles -- as if this <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles --  <unk> <unk> <unk> fast food, <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, I live in a food desert. The Los Angeles South L.A., of the food places to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that places of food to take kill more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Angeles <unk>
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times greater than say, <unk> <unk> that's about 15 miles away.
And I would notice that this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you come out of the house you see the effects that the current food system has in their <unk>
I see <unk> <unk> and sold like <unk> cars.
I see <unk> centers like silicon.
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and the solution.
I also got tired of driving 45 minutes to go back and buy an apple that doesn't have <unk>
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a sliver of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 feet by three feet.
The point is, that belongs to the city.
But you have to run it off.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me in wins, since it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided to get it right.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we put together and we started to plant our forest of food, <unk> trees -- you know, the nine complete vegetables.
What we do, we're a kind of <unk> <unk> made by gardeners of all the entire city <unk> and completely voluntary and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
And then somebody is <unk>
The city looks at me on the top, and I was given a little bit of <unk> saying that I had to take away my garden, the <unk> became made <unk>
And I was like, "Come on me, right?
A court order by planting food on a piece of land that no one <unk>  So I was like, "Well, let's take it up.
Because this time it wasn't going to happen.
The L.A. Times had written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the members of Green Green. who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we went a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the American city with more terrain.
It's got 68 miles of <unk>
That's equivalent to 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space for planting <unk> million <unk> plants.
Why on Earth don't you like this?
We have a plant, 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, <unk> your own food.
You get your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for <unk>
And I grew up there. It was my children there.
I'm going to become part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me, and I'm going to tell you my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I culture, my art.
It's like a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, the <unk> of that canvas.
You get away from seeing what the Earth can do, if you let it be your canvas.
You just can't imagine how astonishing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm a witness of how my garden became a education tool for transformation from my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
They get away from seeing how they affect boys.
<unk> is the most <unk> and provocative act that they can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion, who came a mother and her daughter, and they were like the <unk> at night and they were in my backyard, and I went out and looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this stuff.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I saw people who were so close to me with hunger, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> I don't know that people are going to steal your <unk>
What I say, "Oh God, I don't fear that you go to <unk>
That's the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to <unk> but at the time, I want you to <unk> your <unk>
There was another occasion where I put a garden in a shelter in a shelter in downtown Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, they shared their stories about how this had affected them, and how they used to plant their mom and his grandmother, and it was great to see how it was changed, so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people who are coming, working and <unk> all of a volunteer plan.
If the kids grow up, they will eat <unk>
If you grow some tomatoes, you will eat <unk>  But if none of this will be taught if you're not taught how the food affects the mind and the body, they eat blind people to put them in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which you're trapped and I see these color guys who are on this path designed for them, which doesn't take them anywhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who are taking care of their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take the container and turn them into healthier.
I don't know.
I'm not talking about free, because it free is not sustainable.
The thing about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is putting people out of the street, getting the kids out of the street, who know the joy and the pride of growing their own food, opening markets for farmers.
What I want to do here, we need to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We have to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
<unk> take your <unk> you know?
That is your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, don't call me the comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me in which this is a very nice road.
It's made of <unk> and asphalt is a good thing to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, where it rains, so much.
Can you have a huge amount of water on the asphalt that we <unk>
And especially if you go on your bicycle on your bicycle and these cars go around, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can do a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we would want a quiet road power.
The solution for that is to make roads from asphalt <unk>
The asphalt asphalt is a material that we use now in most roads of the Netherlands, has pores and water can go through it, so that all the rain water flow on the sides and they will have a road that is easy to drive, and we don't have no water anymore.
Noise also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very significant, all the noise -- so it's a very quiet road.
It also has a glimpse of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> See that on this road the stones of the surface are <unk>
First of all, a stone, then several more and more and more, etc., and then then -- well, I won't do that.  But you can damage your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also take more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create bumps with that.
<unk> It's ready.
You know, of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can really see how the damage appears in this material.
It's a asphalt asphalt as I said, so it only has a little amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the <unk> the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> they <unk> and if they <unk> they will be <unk> and they separate from the <unk>
So if you drive through the road, you will take the <unk> you can see it here.
To solve this problem, we think about <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use wool from steel, from that to clean up <unk> and we can cut the steel <unk> into very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel wool on it.
Then you need a machine, like what you see here, that you use to make a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel, very good at that.
So what you have to do is make the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow through these <unk> and the stones are <unk> back to the surface.
Today I used a <unk> because I can't bring the big machine back up here onstage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the sample that I'm now going to get to see what happened.
This is the show that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried a lot of samples out there and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So we had a piece of road, 400 meters of the highway <unk> where we had to do a lane of trial to test this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We made the samples, we put a lot of load on them, the <unk> then with our <unk> machine and we ran them back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we have made a material using steel fibers, bringing these fibers, using the power of <unk> to actually increase the life of the road, even you can actually double the life of the road, you can actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they are curious whether this also worked.
We still have shown here. It's pretty hot.
In fact, it has to cool cool first before you can show you how the repair works.
But I'm going to make a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to News News in his little gray radio.
He had a great smile on his face that was unusual at the time, because the news is usually <unk>
The Taliban <unk> her father.
I didn't know what I did, but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school, he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban got rid of Afghanistan and made illegal girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to meet my older sister who was no longer alone outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way the two could be <unk>
Every day, we had a different route so that no one could suspect where we were headed.
We had to hide the books in market bags so that it looks like shopping.
The school was at a house, more than 100 of us live in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but it's extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Occasionally the school was suddenly <unk> because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew of them.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to do it.
We were <unk> but yet, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan, which is her daughter, my mother, out to school and therefore his father will <unk>
But my educated mother became teacher.
This is it.
It was taken two years ago, just to turn our house in school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first one of his family to get education.
There was no doubt that his children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk for him, not to educate her children.
For the years of the <unk> I remember there were moments that I was very frustrated with our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. Can you help leave your house for a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So you still want to do it.
I am 22 years now.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women of my age have more than <unk> and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate school.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> from his home to educate his daughters, was one of the first ones in <unk>
He wasn't just <unk> from my university degree, but I was also the first woman, and I'm the first woman who I've been driving through the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I am the global ambassador, and it's a global campaign to educate women.
That's why I cofounded <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I look at his parents and their families who, like the mine, <unk> for them, despite the face of an opposition opposition in it.
It's not his true name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter went on the road from <unk> to his village, and literally, they escaped from being killed by a pump on the way, for minutes.
When you get to his house, they are the phone, a voice told him that if he was still sending her daughter to school, they would return to a try.
<unk> right now, if he said, "but I don't harm the future of my daughter for his old and <unk> ideas."
What I've realized about Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people who are <unk> there's a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they are often the first compelling <unk> of the bright future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> girls who went to school they tell <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
We were showing that these changes didn't take a lot, after the retirement U.S.
But when I look back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who were <unk> for them, that the <unk> I see a future <unk> and sustainable change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the girls of <unk> would get it.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never get a <unk> <unk>
There are almost two years since the revolution broke inspired by the surge of mass <unk> both of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside of the country to call a day of anger and start a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was a great revolution.
Women and young men were in the middle, they were in the middle, they were in the middle of the regime, carrying <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
You've shown a bravery copy of the <unk> <unk> dictatorship <unk>
They've shown a sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of the brutal war and a few losses from about 50,000 dead, we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy <unk> a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of the <unk> society.
<unk> of the devastation and the challenges, and I've loved a lot of other women, rebuilding civil society, <unk> an inclusive transition to democracy and just to democracy and national illnesses.
We found about 200 organizations in <unk> for and immediately after every single <unk> About 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of <unk> I went back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm -- I started organizing workshops about the development of capabilities and leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women we founded the <unk> of Women Women <unk> a movement of women, <unk> leaders, to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and our right to participation in the construction of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period, an environment that was getting more and more <unk> than they were talking about political policies and exclusion.
Over time, our initiative was accepted and successfully.
Women won a <unk> Congress in the early elections in 52 years.
However, gradually the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of <unk> of <unk> ancient mosques and <unk>
Another day <unk> with the <unk> of the American Ambassador and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of murder officers of the army.
And every day, every day, we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their <unk> human rights violations.
Our society made a <unk> mindset more <unk> and it has away from ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and revenge became the icons in the revolution.
I'm not here today at all to do it with our history of success of <unk> <unk> and elections.
Rather, I'm here today to confess that we, as nation, we choose wrong, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because the choices didn't bring peace and stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list, and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation, <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated by political policy, of domination and <unk> for men like women?
Maybe what was missing was not just women, but the feminine values of compassion, mercy and mercy and <unk>
Our society needs national dialogue and creating consensus more than the choices that just needed the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs modern representation of the feminine most to need <unk> representation and <unk>
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage, and call it <unk>
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech that not just <unk> but also putting it into respect the mercy instead of <unk> collaboration in place of competition, inclusion rather than exclusion.
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> of the war, desperately needs to be able to reach the peace.
Because peace has a alchemy which is about <unk> and <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> that is known to all the traditions and the same root has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the feminine and <unk> that spans all of the humanity that men and women, which is all tribes and all the tribes have been <unk>
And so, like the uterus completely covers the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion <unk> all the existence.
This is how he tells us, "My mercy goes all the things."
This is how he tells us, "My mercy <unk> about my <unk>
That all of us are given the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a scary question, which has an equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the one that everyone is going to be done.
Why was somebody going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or a social worker, not an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story that count.
I was 22 years old. I had just been at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and he had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I created my soul <unk> I would go to my head with a <unk> <unk> <unk>
The man who loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun into my head and <unk> with <unk> more times that I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap of love, where they fall in every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies from the list <unk> <unk> between these Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I'm nearly 20 years married by my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and I lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all the races, all the religion, all the income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and the domestic abuse, only happens in <unk> <unk> and long duration or said in the families, the last place where we would want or we would expect to be able to figure out why domestic abuse, is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who would sit with a man who sticks, and actually I was a very typical victim for my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States women were in the age of 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls from that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands abusive in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signs or their patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold, rainy night of January.
I was sitting next to my side in New York City and he started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just been <unk> from a college <unk> university and working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and that seemed like a <unk>
I had a lot of <unk> big as apples, and a <unk> <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the most intelligent things that did <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it all over the beginning <unk> in a <unk>
We started out and loved everything about me, which was list, I had gone to Harvard, that I would put passion to teenage girls and my job.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as nobody had ever done before.
And it was so that the bachelor's of that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much importance for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk>
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was to go from New York City and leave my work on my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so <unk> I left my work and <unk> and I went together from Manhattan.
I had no idea that he was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was entering the head of a physical trap a financial and a psychological psychological and careful psychological thing.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how they react to it.
And here is where those <unk> are coming in.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where it was supposed to be so safe and bought three <unk>
One was the <unk> of the car.
Another one he kept under the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that he needed those guns to make it a little bit of the trauma that lived from small.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and even though I never had my hand, my life was already really serious danger, every minute every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning and I still had <unk>
Five days later, when the Ten bruises on my neck had <unk> I got the girlfriend suit and married him.
Despite what had happened, I was confident that we were living happy forever, because I was loved to her, and he also wanted to get a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just had felt very <unk> by the wedding and for the fact of making a family with me.
I had been a isolated accident, and I would never do harm.
I spent two times more on our moon of honey.
The first time I was driving up to a secret beach and <unk> me and he gave me so strong on my head that I would <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back on our <unk> of honey and went through the traffic and threw up a Big Mac to my face.
<unk> she went on, one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was amazed when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three Americans are a victim of domestic violence or bullying.
So actually, I had very good company.
Going back to my question: Why am I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman in love in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> to face their <unk>
The other question that everybody does is, why don't they just <unk>
Why not <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we have to us, the victims, we know something that you know, is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is kill her.
More than 70 percent of domestic violence that occur after the victim has gone to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include the permanent harassment even after the <unk> has become married, and it's <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation of the family court system for <unk> to the victim and their kids, which are typically forced for judges to spend time not to be <unk> with the man who <unk> his mother.
And yet we keep asking why why is it not just going?
I was able to <unk> because of a last <unk> beat up to my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if it was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everybody to the world -- to the police, my neighbors and my friends and my friends and family, to <unk> strangers, and I'm here today.
We have the trend to the victims of the victims like <unk> women, women <unk> <unk> goods.
The question, "Why are you <unk>
For some people who are a way to say <unk> is by <unk> as if the victims of the <unk> committed <unk> by men who want to <unk>
But since I posted <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also learned that they learned a <unk> lesson from what happened to them and that they <unk> their lives joyful and healthy lives like <unk> wives and mothers, fully free of violence like mine.
Because it turns out that I am a victim and a survivor of domestic violence very typical violence.
I got married with a young man, and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What will not come back to have ever been a <unk> pistol pointing to my head in the hands of someone who says I will.
Right now, they are thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> how stupid <unk> but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, which are being <unk> or that they were <unk> or they're <unk> themselves.
The abuse might be affecting her daughter, his daughter, his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love <unk> breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last petition to you.
Talk to what you've heard here.
<unk> lives just in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply throwing light on it.
The victims we need to all the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
Take the abuse of the light on the light talking about it with their children, their colleagues and family.
They <unk> their view of survivors as fantastic people and <unk> who have a future <unk>
We have the <unk> signs of violence to form consciously, to slow down their climbing and show the victims a safe <unk>
And together we can turn our beds, our tables and our families in the oasis and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call me Cameron <unk> and for a while, I am a model.
To be precise, for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this moment there is a <unk> tension in the room because I shouldn't get dressed like this.  luckily, I brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift in clothing on a stage, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to get them now, but we would find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
So these farmers are very <unk> less than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to go through this sweater on the head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so don't do anything as I cover your head.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I have totally changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer said to me that I <unk> the back and <unk> my hair <unk>
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial <unk> like the one that I made two days ago for the work, there is very little we can do to transform our looks, which, although shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave it means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model, a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my workforce, that's a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people are always done, but <unk>
The first question is, how is it going to be model?
And I always say, "A <unk> I was discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason that I made a model of the model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> we also have that associated with a high and <unk> shape, and the <unk> and a white skin.
And that's my <unk> heritage that I've been able to take on to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience that now shows <unk> and maybe there are some of them in the fashion that they go, Stop. There are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> for knowing so much of models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told each and every single role of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models, just <unk> -- which is less than four percent, not white were gone.
The next question that people always do is: Can it be a model when you grow up?"
And my first answer is: I don't know, I'm not about that.
But then, what I would really tell you about each of these girls is: Why?
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, because you were the first.
If after this spectacular list, still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, so I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the head of the American journal <unk> or the CEO of <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you might be a model to say that you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike functional surgery, it can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you've done your studies, and you have a copy and a couple of jobs on your back, no matter what you would -- you know, if you <unk> that you want to be president of the United States, but your copy would be weird.
The next question that people always do is if all of the photos are <unk>
And yes, you know, virtually all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I got to me, and the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're getting into the personal ground, but it was a child.
So I looked at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a few days before the French <unk>
So here I am with my football team and in <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you will realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They are creations of a professional group, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> people and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always do is to do things for free?
I have too many heels. And I have never use, except the previous one, but the privilege I get are I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a store and I forgot to take money, and they gave me a free dress for me.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped a red light and of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent so that I could keep <unk>
And so we made a little bit of these privileges for my way -- not because of what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for how no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, of <unk> teenagers who were couple and 86 percent, 86 percent were black and Latino -- and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino boys in New York, so for them, it's not a matter of <unk>
It's about how many times I am <unk>
When I look at this talk, I learned that at 53 percent of the <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure up to 78 percent to the 17.
So, the last question that people ask me is: How is life in a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is, if you're a little bit thinner and you have the most bright hair, you're going to be very happy and I say.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe this is going to happen.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to be able to work with creative people, clever and <unk>
And that's all true, but it's just one part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I have never said in front of them, is: I'm a <unk>
And I'm because I have to worry about how every single day.
And if you ever ask you yourself, with some more thin legs and the most brilliant hair will be happier?
They just have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most bright legs -- the brightest hair and the <unk> clothes -- but probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But especially it was difficult to look at a situation of racial oppression and gender oppression when I'm one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something that retain this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable in recognizing the power of the image in the perception that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was enough enough to hold a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 more <unk> and I didn't go to me who <unk>
There were no directors, directors, or <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a little bit of care on lighting.
In fact, most of them were taken by 1,000 tourists chance.
My story begins when I was in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday -- that's the corner of 57 and the 5.
He took the chance we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When my third birthday was approaching my daughter, my wife said to me, why don't you take <unk> to New York on a <unk> journey, and you continue to <unk>
So here is when we started asking the tourists that they were going to get to the photo.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete unknown is so universal.
No one has never been denied and fortunately, no one has ever been denied with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change us.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that he was about five years old as I could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time in a October week and to reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in every way.
Because, although we always took the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter comes to new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how they perceive and interact with everything.
That time in concrete that we spend together is something that we expect with illusion every year.
So recently, in one of travel, we were walking, when all of a sudden, it was stopped in dry and pointed at a red <unk> of the retail store in a little previous <unk>
And he described me what it felt at the age of five years standing in that same place.
<unk> that reminded of the heart of <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what looks at in New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we created is the memories.
So I want to share the idea of being actively actively creating conscious memories.
I don't know you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that you get the picture.
So today I want to encourage you to all of this to appear in the picture, and you don't want to go on to get to someone and asked, you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
The <unk> are in the most <unk> <unk> group.
First of all, why are they so bad <unk>
It also has been associated with Disney laughs, as silly characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press press, laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associated with Parliament -- but I don't accept it.
I don't accept. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep clean the environment.  The <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
They're hardly <unk>    And my favorite, the <unk> have better <unk>   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World who are mostly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> where we have 16 species from these 16, 11 communities face a high risk of extinction.
So why are the <unk> are important -- First of all, they provide vital ecological services.
They're our natural garbage <unk>
They <unk> the guys to the bone.
They help kill all the bacteria to help absorb the anthrax that it was not for them would spread and cause large losses of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the men take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have enormous historical importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture.
<unk> was the symbol of lip and the maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the High and lower Egypt.
In the <unk> Hindu <unk> <unk> was the <unk> god and <unk> his life to save the <unk> <unk> of the Tasmanian <unk>
In <unk> culture, they are doing very important <unk> in places like the <unk> there is no place to bury the dead, or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural <unk> system.
What's the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are <unk>
The reason is they're being <unk> and the reason they're <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in the South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are at the critical list of endangered terms, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years is <unk> and the reason is because they fall from <unk> <unk> which has been treated with <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned for veterinarian in India and they've taken a statement.
Because there is no <unk> there have been a spread in the number of dogs on the number of dogs on <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge amount of time <unk> and the number of instances of rage has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up from Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk> of birds.
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade for dead dead to serve the <unk> and the market of <unk>
So what are you doing? Well, we're investigating these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine its basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so I'm going to focus on a senior problem is not going to be at all.
We have to work with governments in the regional levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we have.
How can they help? It can become assets, making noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell them we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you get out of this room, you will tell you about <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors about <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed because he saw it <unk> without energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life -- it's been <unk> for seven years of work in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set in Africa <unk>
And I was <unk>
<unk> to the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything that we played the <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where I wanted to teach people from Zambia to grow food.
So we get to the seeds of <unk> to the south of Zambia to this absolutely amazing valley that descends into the river <unk> and we teach local local tomatoes and <unk> and <unk>
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, by what they would give them to come to work, and sometimes they weren't <unk>  We were amazed that the local, in as fertile valley, wouldn't have had agriculture.
However, instead of asking them how it was possible to be able to do anything, we just said, "Thank God that we're here."
And of course, everything in Africa became <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato reef into this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> "Look at how easy the <unk>
When tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red at night, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yeah, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you do it? "You're never <unk>
I thought that only we Italians <unk> errors in Africa, but then, I saw what Americans, what Americans, and what the French were doing, and then seeing what they were doing, I felt quite proud of our project in Zambia.
Because you see, at least we feed the <unk>
We would look at the <unk>  <unk> to see the waste that gave them to <unk> people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors have delivered to African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about damage that that money has <unk>
They just read their book.
It was part of an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries missionaries and treat people just two things: or <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
Yet they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture as if you were my kids, I want you a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture as if they were my <unk>
That's why white people in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "The little is <unk> written by <unk> who said about all economic development -- if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the floor, and he said, "We can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to be 27 years to just respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never really start nothing, you never motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have sleep to become a better person.
So what do you do? Do you <unk>
You never get to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of <unk>
We don't work from the offices.
We put together in a coffee at a coffee bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important.
The passion that man has for its own personal growth is the most important.
And then, we help them find the knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not for once, but not in <unk> meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the <unk> meetings.
<unk> are never going to be <unk> and they're never going to say, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what a chance have they <unk>
So, planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know them, because they don't present to their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You should create a new profession.
The profession is the family member of the company, the family family doctor who sets up with you in your house, at the table of your kitchen, in the coffee, and that helps you find the resources to transform his passion in a way of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get away from this junk garbage where we got to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects online, and the government came to see me to ask, "How can you do that?
How can you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very difficult.
And so I <unk>   So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped start 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business <unk> in history, passed away from '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a philosophy of philosophy before he involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says, <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and an economy of <unk>
The planning is the kiss of death of the corporate spirit.
So now <unk> reconstructing <unk> without knowing what people most <unk> in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to a conversation with you.
You have to offer you support, privacy, has to be great to the help and then they will be able to come in mass numbers.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you talk about -- you know, more this tomorrow?
<unk> local people.
So, what I'm telling you is that the spirit entrepreneur is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- <unk> fossils -- not renewable energy, <unk> and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of sustaining <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do that.
Who's going to invent the technology for the green revolution -- the <unk> <unk>
The government?
They'll be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a wonderful story that I read in a <unk> magazine, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in <unk>
And in the year <unk> came together this group of people -- and <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wouldn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population is kept growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in dung.  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> New York City.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States, there were <unk> mining companies, <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few things to build factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise, they won't come to speak with you.
Then you have to offer an absolute <unk>
And then later you will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the bigger company has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to have a fantastic marketing and you have to have a fantastic financial administration.
You know what?
We never met a single human being in the world that can do, to sell and look for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is not not born.
We've looked at and looked at the 100 icons icons in the Carnegie <unk> -- <unk> Ford, all the new companies -- Google, <unk>
There's only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common, only one, no one was started by one person.
I never know the word -- but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it began.
No one begins a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business in small business -- in <unk> along with their dedicated dedicated developments to do for you, what somebody did for you, what someone did for this <unk> somebody who speaks to you, what does it take?
What can you do? Can you do that?
Well, you can see it. You can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do it." <unk> I look for <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
<unk> around us can help us from many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't swap a lot of knowledge a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> <unk> and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door in a <unk> moment?
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share our hopes more our hopes for empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New York, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> that give <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries ago, and I trust a city.
It always comes to the music.  There's a runway in New York --  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the highest amount of abandoned U.S.
I live around this house and I thought about how it could turn into a more nice space for the neighborhood, and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and death.
And this was a deep gratitude for the time that I lived and lived in time.
He understood the significant things in my life today.
But let's try to keep this look in my everyday life.
I think it's easy to be able to be able to catch on the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends I transformed the wall of this left house on a giant board and painted on it on her phrases to <unk> "Before she die <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspiration in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled with and kept <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before he died, I want to be trial on <unk>  "Before you die I want to sit on the line of <unk>
Before he died, I want to sing for millions of people."
Before she died, I want to plant a <unk>
Before she died, I want to live outside the <unk>
Before he died, I want to get it over again.
Before she died, I want to go to the <unk>
Before he died, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space, and they became constructive and dreams and hopes of people and hopes for people laughing at me and gave me comfort in difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It is about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about going to fight the reflection and the <unk> and to remember what is the most important thing for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center, we made a kit, and now they've made walls in countries around the world, like Kazakhstan, South Africa, Argentina and beyond.
And together we showed the power of our public spaces if we give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions increasing, is more important than ever before, finding ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is short and fragile.
Death is something that we often avoid talking or even thinking, but I understood that preparing for death is one of those things that we become more power.
If you think about death, our lives.
Our shared spaces can actually reflect what we care about as individuals and as community and more media to share hope and stories, the people around us not only can help make places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 and it's very <unk>
Don't speak, but it brings joy than some of the best <unk>
<unk> knows what love.
It's shared. <unk> happen to happen.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
You don't care about religious differences and focus on this: It's never <unk>
When singing songs of our childhood, trying to speak words that I don't even want to be <unk> I would remember one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very hot.
You get the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but remember the year when each of the songs of my iPod, conversation that we had four years old, and you pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
It doesn't look like <unk>
But most people don't agree with it.
And in fact, because your minds don't fit into the concept of normal society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although I wouldn't consider them within it, that could only mean one thing: which was <unk> autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes to physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself in a different way of there that <unk> is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is diagnosed with a new case of autism, and although it's one of the developmental disorders that are faster in the world, there's no cause or no known.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was only three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new life in my life.
When I spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
He lived and lived in his own world, with his own rules, and she found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting cars into row around the room, looking at the washing machine and eating anything that was <unk>
As I grew up, it became more different, and the differences were made more <unk>
But beyond the <unk> frustration and <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent -- a child that I saw the world without biases, a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some tough moments in my family, moments that I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that wouldn't want to change by normal.
<unk> passes through the beauty that gives us differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that any one is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and Sam and <unk> would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift inside and honestly, the pursuit of normal is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for oxytocin is the progress and the change of change at the moment that we try to be like each other.
Please. Don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what it must have been <unk> in the <unk>
Penn State asked me a communications teacher to give me a kind of communication to engineering.
I was scared.  I was really afraid of the <unk> of these students with their great minds, their great books and their great words.
But when those conversations, I felt what they were doing, it must have felt like when she fell through the hole of the rabbit and saw the door of a new world.
So I felt like I had these conversations with the students, and I was surprised the ideas they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones who are attacking our larger challenges -- from energy to environment, and health care and health care -- and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as no scientists to have these interactions.
But these great conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please have <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that their science is sexy and their engineering is attractive.
First question to <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us just that we study the <unk> but studying the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you're describing your science <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing as <unk>
Instead, as Einstein, said that everything as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can actually communicate their science without engaging ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies are ways of <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And when I introduce their work, forget the signs of <unk>
You have wondered why they call <unk>  So what do they do <unk> <unk> kill me, and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's been supporting too much in the language of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of the <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of the Tower <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple <unk> <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a bit of a bit, and then provide graphs that will lead to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what it <unk>
I think these are just some key ones that can help others to open the door and look at the country of the wonders that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, all of the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the Oxford English <unk> is <unk>
Just because it sounds very well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
There was an editor <unk> from the 19th century that defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is the one looking for a public charge no matter whether platform or principle, and when he wins, you get it for pure use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means to <unk>
One thing to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, that Parliament Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that were told in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the bravery of a guy with the little-known name of <unk> <unk> who was confronted by Parliament.
They put him in the Tower of London and he <unk> but he had the courage to face them, and at the end it had such popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later, we had the first recorded use of the phrase <unk> <unk> like the <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It isn't. It's for an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how you call George Washington a leader.
You didn't know it.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This was <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all kinds of suggestions that could be <unk>
Some people wanted to call it the <unk> state and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the United States <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was about <unk>
And even with it they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be King elected by a fixed term.
And you could have <unk>
The whole world got tired of them, because this debate went down for three weeks.
And I read the newspaper in a poor <unk> and always <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to be <unk>
They didn't want to call him King by if he was giving him or his designated ideas.
So they wanted to give the title more <unk> more <unk> and more unfortunate and the most unfortunate <unk>
And that title was <unk>
President. I didn't invent the title. There was before, but it just meant <unk> that I would take a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have a lot more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were presidents and <unk> <unk> <unk> and thousands of government, but it was really a insignificant.
And that's why the Senate is <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign <unk> and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who would be serious with a degree so <unk> and <unk> as President of <unk>
And then finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate doesn't exist.
We can learn three interesting things from all this.
First of all, and this is my favorite thing to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> as well as the <unk>
President Barack Obama got lucky to go on there, waiting for the Senate to action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when one government says that a measure is <unk> --  -- we might have to move forward to a few years more.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and this is what I want to tell you, is that the title of President in America does not sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 warheads and <unk> the largest economy of the world and a fleet of <unk> flying vehicles, and so on.
Reality and history have endowed with the title of <unk>
So at the end I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was an uniqueness of then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end, the Senate won and the House of <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that they're now President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to <unk>
politicians try to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but actually change the words much more the words than these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 feet underground.
The air is <unk> and dust, and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see a lot more.
I hear voices that speak but, above all, that cacophony of <unk> male and stones with primitive.
Like each other, I wear a cheap flashlight on the <unk> he holds the head with this rubber rubber and I can barely tell the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole in a meter that drops hundreds of meters on the ground.
It <unk> my hand and all of a sudden I remember a <unk> I met before, who lost the control and got countless feet in that well.
While I talk to you today, these guys are deep in that hole in the risk of their lives without paying a reward and often, dying.
I went out of that hole and I went home, but they might never will, because they're prey to slavery.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the Peace Peace Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there I met in a <unk> <unk> the <unk> a <unk> which is investing in modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not as a degree.
When we ended up talking to me, I felt very sad, I was trying to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made a <unk> and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
This is how my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
Some of the most considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are now over 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of Africans displaced during all of its slaves <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 people today.
However, today you can enslaving entire families for generations to <unk> <unk>
Surprisingly, slavery generates revenues from more than 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false goods promises of good education and better work to find that they're forced to work without pay, under violence and cannot escape.
Today, the slavery today operates in <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce them are disposable are disposable them.
slavery exists in almost everybody and yet it's illegal throughout the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This bizarre show was like entering the old Egypt of Egypt or <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 degrees -- men, women, in fact, families in fact, <unk> in a heavy canopy of <unk> mechanically mechanically bricks in their heads, even 18 at the time, and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
They went through <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 hours a day.
There was no pause to eat, not to drink, and the severe <unk> made it just pee on <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the powder that my camera became too hot to touch and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and sitting there, I thought, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was quickly on my side quickly grabbed me and said, "You don't do it. Don't do it here."
And it explained to me very clearly that demonstrating emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
It couldn't offer any direct aid.
I couldn't give you money, nothing.
I was not the citizenship of that country.
I could put them in a worse situation than they were.
I had to rely on the <unk> the <unk> and work within the system for his release and he trusted the <unk>
In terms of me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found kids carrying stones for miles on <unk> to trucks that were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the children could charge and the children <unk> their heads with straps made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all their life.
They have nothing to do with it?
When these villagers <unk> his freedom, the <unk> had been <unk>
When you hear the word <unk> we often think of sexual traffic and because of this world consciousness warned me that it would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk>
I was driven by a few <unk> that gave me this <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in exile are local for prostitution prostitution <unk>
They have small, private rooms where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of only seven years -- they're forced to entertain the clients and to <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each of them is dark, <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers are often suffer by sexual abuse of their clients.
From the <unk> I remember a sense of <unk> <unk> and in that instant, I barely could imagine what it should be stuck in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs where they were <unk>
There was no doors <unk>
There were no windows like it to be <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because you touch this difficult subject, it's important to point out that slavery even sexual trafficking, is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 Americans are sold every year as sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to labor <unk>
I went to Indian villages in which there were entire families in the trade of silk.
This is a family portrait of family.
The black hands of black are the father, and the <unk> of blue and red, of her children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My <unk> told me his stories.
"We don't have <unk> they said.
We still need to be able to get out of this house one day and go to another place where you really pay for our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to get a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a fishermen of fishermen on a boat, two brothers, a few younger kids, a few younger kids, make sense of it.
<unk> were all slaves.
Kids are separated from their families and <unk> <unk> and forced to work with a few boats of these boats in the lake, despite not knowing to swim.
This boy is eight years old.
When our boat came along, he came up with this thing that his little canoe was <unk>
He was paralyzed by the fear of falling to water.
The <unk> branches of trees plunged into Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, <unk> and fear, it gets to the water to unlock the branches.
A lot of <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
For fear of his love it's not going to flee and, like the whole life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> is about the younger slaves under his command.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they were <unk> the last <unk> but they had been working from the one of the one of the one that had been working on.
On the cold evening and <unk>
And you can point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter in which I was looking at the <unk> <unk> to the victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who will come to be because somebody decided to make a difference in their life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with partners from <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with their motorcycle suddenly sped up and <unk> our car and played the window.
He asked us to take it down a road to the jungle.
At the end of the road, we were terrified to go out of the car, and asked the driver to go out very quickly.
And then you come to this path barely visible and said, "This is the way, this is the path.
As we started <unk> we removed the <unk> that <unk> the path and after walking close to an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the photos of photos on my head as they went to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> path ended up in one of course, and we had a mass of holes that could fit into a football camp -- and they were all full of migrant workers.
A lot of women had little kids strapped on their backs, and they were looking for gold <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
The <unk> is used in the <unk> process.
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump were <unk> in their own <unk>
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because many people had been underground for 72 hours.
<unk> have to be 90 feet and these people carry heavy bags of stone that will then be transported to another area where they would choose the stone to extract the gold.
The site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer to the margin we see each other and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, diseases and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> is finished as this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> by <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died he took him to work with him in the mines.
He died his uncle, <unk> I held the debt of the uncle the force to be slave in mines.
When I met him, she had worked in the mines 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product in the <unk> so severe that doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has <unk> and yet, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dream to be liberated and educated with help from local activists like <unk> the <unk> and this kind of determination, of face to a possibility remote, which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to shine a light on slavery.
Did you know that your images would be seen for you around the world.
I wanted you to know that we will be testament to them and that we will make everything possible to help change their lives.
<unk> I think if we can see ourselves with each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult for atrocities like slavery.
These images are not magazines. They're from people, real people, like you, and like me, who deserve the same rights dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that I'm going to think about these so many beautiful people that I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images wake up a force in whom you see in people like you, and I hope that that force turns on a fire and that fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do applied math and there is a peculiar problem for whom we are, we are like the management consultants <unk>
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
<unk> is one of the most human activities.
We were terrified of the <unk> of the ballet and the dancers of <unk>  that we will see later.
But the ballet demand is a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of skill and probably some <unk> starting that well can have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's disease, destroy this extraordinary ability to do it with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at the time was a <unk> ballet dancer
In the last few years, there's a lot of progress in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> stiffness and other symptoms of this disease, so we need objective tools to detect disease before it is too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we will know whether there's a cure for us to be when we have an objective measure and <unk>
But it's frustrating for Parkinson's disease, and other disorders of movement have no biological markers, so they don't use blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological <unk> test.
You have to go to a clinic to do that. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, out of clinical trials, they never do.
What if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the test of them.
It wouldn't be <unk>
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to think about, as no conventional form to try, you see, in some sense at least, we are all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of vocal ropes <unk>
It shows somebody as well as it emits sounds of talking, we can imagine as dancers of a vocal <unk> because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes that are <unk> for example.
And as they did it requires an extraordinary <unk>
Let's think about time that leads to a child to learn how to speak.
From the sound, we can track the position of the vocal cords as we <unk> and as the Parkinson's affects the <unk> also affects the vocal organs.
On the plot below, you can see an example of <unk> <unk> of vocal ropes <unk>
We see the same <unk>
Give a lot of <unk> weakness <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and transformed after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice of <unk> <unk> Well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
They are both <unk> OK, but in addition to <unk> scores are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They are very quickly, they take about 30 seconds a lot.
They're <unk> and we all know what happens is happening.
When something takes away a <unk> cost. <unk>
These are some amazing lists to address.
We can reduce our patients.
It would not do to go to the clinic for <unk> routine.
<unk> <unk> we could get goals.
We could make a massive <unk> <unk> for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it's too late.
So when we give them today the first steps in that sense, we are launching the Parkinson's <unk> Initiative.
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with or no Parkinson's, can call low price and stop for about cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So I will take all these samples of, let's say 10,000 people, you can say who is healthy and who doesn't?
What are you going to take out of these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the mental TR: Yeah.
<unk> You see, some people can not <unk> you might not get it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data in different ways, and do it in different circumstances that's important because we're looking for <unk> factors to look for real markers of disease.
TR: You have a accuracy accuracy on this moment?
<unk> a lot more than that.
In fact, my student <unk> I have to do a fantastic job and now it has shown that it works on the mobile phone network too, what we would take on the project. We now have a precision.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> audience.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March 2011, I was doing <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We spread out in the darkness, in no windows and no windows and we usually avoid sunlight.
We make the thin thin models even more <unk> the perfect skin even more perfect -- we do the impossible possible and we would focus on the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a good taste for the images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Soon after that, an organization where I was <unk> there was a place that was working on as a part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 13 went to <unk>
It's a little fishing village in the <unk> <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave.
<unk> water level took over 24 feet tall and more than three kilometers away inside.
As you can imagine, the people was <unk>
They made rubble from the channels and the <unk>
<unk> schools. We removed the slime and we left ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of fish from dead fish, <unk> <unk> from the local city.
We <unk> us and loved it.
For weeks, enough volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found photos and <unk> pictures and cameras and cards, <unk>
Everybody did the same thing.
They were going to take them to different places of villages around them to <unk>
It wasn't until so I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that those people had anticipated.
As we went from <unk> and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help me in a village village center.
It helped clean the toilets, huge <unk> gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the center of the <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor that I had the honor of that day I had the honor of my hands on me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard of the expression to think beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I reached my horizons that something happened.
By looking at the pictures, I found some that had over a hundred years of people were still in the lab, I couldn't help but think about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I walked into Facebook contacted with some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive and I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get a lot of precision and <unk>
In the other way, that little girl would not have the aspect of it, and that would be so tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over the time step over time, they came by luck by luck more photos, and they took more <unk> so I went into Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 people in 12 countries were offered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were inviting us to <unk> a village to Northern <unk>
Once we had a week we use our scanner in the libraries that are very skilled libraries that were <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that we had in <unk> is a different story, depended on the <unk> of the photos.
I could serve an hour. I could make weeks for weeks.
It could be a few months old.
This <unk> had to draw in pretty much hand using a guide and the areas whose color and the water had no <unk>
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these photos of <unk> in seawater, covered in bacteria, with algae, even with oil, all of that along with the step of the time I continue to <unk> for that <unk> to hand was an important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the picture unless it was clean <unk> and it was <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky to <unk>
We have a <unk> of a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm even the photos that are already <unk>
As a <unk> once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures got to be lucky to the photos.
He had begun to <unk> she himself, but she stopped realizing that the <unk> even more.
He also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and his own face would not be <unk> we were able to put the images in a single picture and make the whole picture.
And when I picked up his photos he shared something about his story with us.
A few colleagues from her husband found the photos on a fire station between the rubble very far away from where she used to be their house, but his colleagues <unk>
The tsunami of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
It had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Their little children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took a week to find his whole family and know that everybody had survived.
The day I gave him his pictures his youngest son, <unk>
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift that I could see -- something that he could look at, something that could remember the past that would not have been marked on the day of March when everything in his life changed or was <unk>
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined up there -- hundreds of them helped us clean up more than <unk> photographs -- the great <unk> -- the vast majority came back to their <unk> <unk>
Over 500 volunteers around the world helped us bring back to 90 families -- hundreds of photos completely <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we really don't spend more than <unk> by teams and materials, most of them in ink for <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of somebody or something, a relationship, one relationship, somebody loved it.
They are <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing that we would wear but the first thing that we would take to look for.
This is about this project, to restore small pieces of humanity, to bring someone into their connection to the past.
When a picture like this comes back to somebody, it's not a huge difference in the life of the person that you get in.
This project also made a big difference in the life of the <unk>
Some of them connected with something bigger with something larger, to bring something, using their talent for something that are not thin models of perfect skin.
So I would like to read this email -- he sent him Cindy the day I came back from Japan after six months.
As long as I did, I couldn't stop thinking about the people and the stories shown in the images.
One particular one in particular, a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathering about a baby, and I had a child, because a similar picture of my family, my mother, my mother, and my <unk> daughter <unk> on our wall.
In the whole world, in all of our basic needs are the same, right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> were inspired by awe and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that cuts through an apple in an exhibit just a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create videos in slow motion on motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that can see behind them, beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and challenge the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and switch it on and put it up in a <unk> of a second or a number of <unk> to create a package of photons for just one millimeter size.
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet is a <unk>
If we take that bullet and this package of photons and you would go into this bottle, how you spread around those photons inside this <unk>
What's the aspect of light in the <unk>
Now, all of this --  --  -- remember, all of this is actually happening in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel to the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light on motion.
Coca-Cola is not going to do this research                 <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a pack of photons which starts <unk> and that, inside, it starts to <unk>
And part of the light goes down to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons eventually get to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounces inside the inside.
At that time, the waves travel on the table and because of the thoughts at the top you see it at the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights were <unk>
Now, if we take a common bullet and the current bullet and we make it go down the same distance and see it in slow motion to about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to see that film?
One day? One week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring film -- a slow slow <unk>
And how about testing nature <unk>
You can see the waves that go from the table, and the tomato wall.
It's like throwing a rock in a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought of a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look at this <unk> you will realize that, as the light gets rid of the tomato <unk> it's still bright.
Why? Because the tomato <unk> and light bounces on its interior and then it goes back from several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your cell phone, you'll be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to touch it.
So why do we create this camera in the <unk>
As photographers, you know, if we took a picture on the <unk> it comes very little light in.
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than the shortest exhibition than the shortest exposure to get into a little bit of light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those <unk> data and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in raw and very interesting ways.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, they can become invisible, too.
And if a new power of a future <unk> would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw something out of light on the door. We'll go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
We could extract those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We've built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our paper in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera, but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works like this, our <unk> has unique capabilities in it.
It has very good time resolution and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also the hidden objects -- but we don't know what point corresponds to what a distance.
When a laser project can be record a photo on the <unk> you see on the screen, it really doesn't make any sense.
But we will take lots of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we'll try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the object <unk>
Could we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before you get this into the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what is around the curve, around the curve, around.
Or we could search for survivors in dangerous conditions looking at light reflected through open windows in the ground.
Or we could build <unk> that could be able to see the inside of the body by using <unk> and the same thing for the <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood is quite difficult, so this is actually a asked for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new <unk> of visualizing the next generation of the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> He was a scientist, it turned science into art, an art of <unk>
And I realized that all the <unk> of data that we collect every time is not just scientific visualizations but we can see that we can see.
So creating a new form of computer photography with slow camera and color colors.
And let's look at those waves. Remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But here it also happens something fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are going on from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have strangers. So Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order that events happen in the world sometimes comes in front of the camera.
We have the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can change life, and gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone, you can put a crime against the humanity in Syria.
With a cell phone you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone you can record a song, and you can record them and get famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and I live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this town.
Here you can see hundreds of thousands of people who are looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all these people gathered that they <unk> in search of a change, they had a cell phone in your pocket.
Who have a cell phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phones, <unk>
<unk> A Blackberry, <unk>
That's a lot of all today having a cell today.
But today I'll talk to me today about my mobile, and how life changed me.
I'll talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
There's raw data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. Commission filed a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every European telephone company, every single Internet vendor in all Europe, has to store a wide range of data from users.
Who calls Al <unk> who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use your phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and up to two years, in their phone company or its <unk>
And all across Europe, people stood and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this retention of data.
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone providers.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> <unk>
And some of them even said this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of Eastern Germany.
And I also asked me if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Whenever I use your <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> that at that time, it was the largest telephone company in Germany, which please get me all the information you had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to me, and I didn't get a concrete answer. It was all blah, <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to take a lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, they <unk>
It takes demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court <unk> the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly thing about brown with a CD inside.
And the CD had this.
Thirty thousand dollars is 30 percent of information.
At first I saw them and I said, well, it's a huge archive OK.
But after a time I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information to <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data means.
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in, and you can go back and go back and forward.
You can see every step I want to do.
And you can see how I go from <unk> on <unk> and what often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's about all of us.
First of all, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then you call the other, and the other one another, and we end up with this big communications network.
You can see how your people communicate each other what time they call each other, what time they go to sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who speaks to whom, who sends an email for who, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and up to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a cell phone in your pocket.
And <unk> would have known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> would have known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall has never happened.
And as a result, neither is the fall of <unk>
Because today the state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible within and out of the web.
They want to have the ability to follow our lives and they want to be <unk> forever.
But the <unk> and living in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for the <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and it's not just after fashion.
When you go home, tell your representative that only because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information you store of you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones that gives you to remember that you have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
I call me <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
I read my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> the poor of me in the process.
And as a result, I have cerebral palsy, so I <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
Muhammad <unk>
<unk> is not genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
No one -- the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were brothers, though they are.
It only happens by accidents, like the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration. And I don't want any of you there.
I feel bad for me, because at some point in life, you wish to be disabled.
Go for a walk.
<unk> at Christmas, are at the shopping mall, drive in circles and search for parking lot and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. is just one of them.
There was a <unk> of <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a Muslim <unk> woman, disabled and alive in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm a <unk> Park in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my disease had the same early ones.
I also love that if I want to walk from my home to New York, I do it.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe in <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three largest sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three older sisters were going to public school, my parents were <unk> the school system and <unk> that I was also out of it, and if I didn't have any note on the top of my mother. I had my mother.
My father taught me how to walk at five years by putting my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another tactic that I used was just to hang on a dollar in front of me so that it was <unk>
The <unk> that I've been inside it was very strong and so on.
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten kindergarten was walking like a <unk> champion who received many <unk>
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city, and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic, and they're still all of the family.  I think no one realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to <unk> to the <unk> as a campaign.
The people I grew up with no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of dying of hunger during the <unk>
I was telling them that he had enough fat to live three months without eating, so <unk> at dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy -- so they sent me to school dance.
I learned to dance with <unk> or I learned to <unk>
I am from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends were using <unk> as well.
And when my friends were going to spend summer vacation at the coast of Jersey, I wasn't going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we weren't going back to Palestine all the <unk> we would fall into <unk>
On the summer summer often my father was trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> and I would get hot cups on my back, and I would remember the water <unk> and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I should say it's very boring, but before you do yoga I was a comedian of <unk> who couldn't stand up <unk> <unk>
And now I can <unk> in your head.
My parents had this idea that I could do anything, that any dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital.
I went to college by the positive discrimination and I got a scholarship to the University of the state of Arizona, because in all the <unk>
It was like the pet <unk> of the theater department.
They all <unk>
I did all the most intelligent tasks I took on the top of my lectures, and also in their classes.
Every time I was doing a scene from the glass zoo my teachers <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to do a work called <unk> very slow on <unk>
It's a work of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at four <unk> "He will have a <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of this, they <unk>
Thank God <unk> at the end I'm <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  You got it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the head of the theater, crying like someone had killed my cat, how to ask her why and she told me that because they could not do the risk scenes.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the risk stunts you can't do the <unk> either.
It was a paper that literally had been born and gave him an actress without cerebral <unk>
University was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors for a disabled career.
When I graduated home, I went home, and my first tour tour, was an extra <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> to <unk> <unk> friend in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that the <unk> <unk> don't <unk> <unk> not white, with disability.
They just give them to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up looking at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
That's why I became <unk>
On my first tour, I took famous comics from New York to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that led when she was at the high speed on the highway in New Jersey with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs -- and I worked in Arabic in the Middle East, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know they never heard that little nasty rumor that women are not fun, and they find a lot of fun.
In 2003, my brother from another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the New York City Festival in New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative picture of the <unk> in media media and once remind the directors of <unk> that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs were much easier to fight the challenge of <unk>
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I went like invited to the news program for cable <unk>
I walked out as if I went to a graduate dance, I went to a study and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> you can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I clung to the desk of the host for not coming out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't come back.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I stayed like the <unk> and I hit my chair.
Something a fun thing that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It tells you that kids are <unk> but they never <unk> from me no little girl.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
<unk> clips online with comments like, "Why <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> was a terrorist.
What disease does it have?
We really should be praying for her."
A guy suggested that I would take my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The disability is as visual as race.
If someone in wheelchair can't do <unk> then you can't make somebody on the wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors were saying not to go down, but I'm here in front of you.
However, we have grown up with media media, I don't think they <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday lives.
Maybe if there were more positive images, I would get less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we even need all the society to teach our children.
My journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet for the <unk> <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world, Arabs have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> a charity to give children refugee refugee to provide a smallest part of what my parents would be.
It was the only time my father saw me working live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
My name is <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I would like to tell you a story about a child from a young town.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
She lives in a small town to the South <unk>
This village is about <unk>
<unk> drives the small village to poverty and on the brink of <unk>
Without it, it goes to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When you get there, there's no opportunities, no jobs, no <unk>
He has just been living in a tent in the city outside <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day he was about a guy who offers him to <unk> after dinner, to dinner, to <unk>
We got a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
He gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home to your family.
He presented to a young man.
She finally went home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts a car bomb.
That little boy of that little village with dreams of the great city was the terrorist terrorist and that dynamic group of people were in the <unk> a terrorist organization with al Qaeda.
So how did the story of a small village in a small village trying to fulfill the dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a perspective, and this was the first thing he arrived.
This was the first thing that pulled him out of what we call the <unk>
And their story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
This is the history of the <unk> young urban urban <unk> riots in <unk> riots in London, looking for something beyond <unk> <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity for jobs, for well-being, but young people are not involved in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth who suffers from the highest <unk> rates.
By 2030, three of every five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them opportunities, the history of the <unk> of <unk> the door of access to terrorism, to violence -- will be the history of cities 2.0.
And in my hometown of birth, I was about 70 percent of young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, not to school.
They don't do anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital in the hospital where I was born.
I remember being in front of that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I would never have he never gone?
And if I'd been forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was at <unk> that month was actually to support some youth leaders at a business profession.
They went to about 90 leaders juvenile leaders.
We sat down and we had a rainwater on the solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no work, no opportunities.
I remember when he said to me, because I was a graduate university university, she was the perfect white woman for Al <unk> and other <unk> organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to point B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war had completely destroyed the traffic system and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and the <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
He started <unk> to the local residents who were normally able to <unk>
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some time to expand hundreds of motorcycles for the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story do you do?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the spirit of corporate spirit, and I think that the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so effective.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of business initiative, and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business initiative.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in more than 22 years ago, and until Mohamed arrived, if Mohamed wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were sent from the <unk>
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So, Mohamed saw a chance.
It started a company of <unk> and design.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and started to grow <unk> and <unk> that he was able to survive the hard weather of <unk>
And it began the delivery of flowers for wedding gardens by creating gardens in houses, and the city companies, and now it's working on the creation of the first public park in 22 years.
There's no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where families, young people, can go together, and like he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't <unk> because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the young, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on the young.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for government, but their history, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
encouraged them to believe that they might be entrepreneurs, that they could be <unk> of change.
For the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
We would give business solutions for local problems.
So we inspire young people and create a culture of corporate spirit -- is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and guidance to engage them in development and set out to be <unk>
<unk> young people with the resources that they need, and they need support that they need to move from conception to the understanding of the creation, and they will create for the urban growth.
For me, the spirit of business is more than to start a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed not simply selling flowers.
I think he's selling hope.
His Peace Park, this is how it's called, when it's created, it will transform the way people see their city.
I hired kids from the street to help rent and keep the motorcycles for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape <unk> paralysis of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to turn young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eating their innovation <unk> and they will have more stories about flowers and <unk> than <unk> and <unk> in <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> mountains, a <unk> area north of the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun made it that leaves <unk> like a <unk> and it won't be on the way that we were almost able to pretend we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We came to our camp.
It was a <unk> in a <unk> view of a beautiful famous lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four square feet with cardiac hearts balls out of aluminum paper balls and old.
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> they were too lazy to pull out what they thought was going to clean up their <unk>
That question followed me, and a little bit of <unk>
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how we <unk> or where we <unk> the <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris, or in <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean our junk -- at 11 tons of waste and two thousand tons of <unk> products every day.
I wanted to meet you as individuals.
I wanted to understand who that work.
What does it feel to use and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through his pathways, and I interviewed people in office and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed a little bit more.
So I started working like <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I was <unk>
And he <unk> the mechanical and bar <unk>
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe it, and in the days that it's very strong you will be rapidly <unk>
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies were still <unk> to the weight of getting on their body tons of garbage every weeks.
It's also danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> company, the harvesting of waste is one of the ten <unk> most dangerous <unk> and I learned why.
You are coming out and coming into the traffic all day and they're <unk> around you.
They just want to <unk> so the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the worker.
And also, the trash itself is full of dangers that often fall off the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the relentless of trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
He never came to come.
It's also as a form of breathing or circulation.
It should always be moving.
And there's also stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe strongly that waste waste are the most important work of the city streets for three reasons.
They're the first protective of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste of the efficient and effective way every day, this starts to <unk> from their containers and its dangers inherent to us in very real ways.
We had been controlled for decades and centuries and <unk> and they start to <unk>
The economy needs them.
If we can't get rid of the old we have no space for the new so that the engines of the economy begin to fail when it's on consumer <unk>
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just pointing its relationship.
And then it's what I call the average speed we need.
So what I mean is just at the speed of the time that used to be used at the time <unk>
We usually don't get <unk> or <unk> or we carry on our coffee cup -- our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use them -- the <unk> we forgot about them, because we know that there's a work force on the other side that it takes about it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about the collection of waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her job, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, in a <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when they <unk>
And their work allows us to do ours.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that maintain us except for ourselves, from our own <unk> our own <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
On the one day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a <unk> truck on the street, grabbed my little son, <unk> and I went down the stairs <unk> and there was a man doing his journey to recycled recycled paper as he did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank her work that particular day, but I started crying.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be okay."
Shortly after that I started researching the collection of waste and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we work together a lot of times and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist on this planet as species we have to include and have to account at all cost, even the very real human cost of the labor of labor.
The city waste -- what we think of when we talk about trash, they represent three percent of the amount of waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic here.
So on the flow of their days and their lives, the next thing that you see someone whose job is to clean up the junk of you, <unk> a moment for <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our community life forming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from the conditions and local traditions.
I brought two recent projects as an example of this.
Both projects are located in countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final work of architecture.
The first example began with an invitation to design a <unk> mall in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as example, my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought about was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores in which people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to spend a lot of energy because the skin of crystals generates heat inside, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it is a temperate change that goes from 20 to 25 degrees per year.
And thirdly, her view has nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a shame for a place that rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really <unk> with the old market that is this structure in the open air, where thousands of people go and buy things every day to small <unk>
There's also that idea of using public space to generate foreign activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a shopping center.
But the question was how to build a whole building, a whole building, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the arena of the site, which is located in a much growth area of the city, where a lot of the buildings that we see in the image, didn't exist yet.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of meters.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, putting all the entries from the building.
And this is extends with a <unk> <unk> which creates a space that creates a space in the building that are <unk> by its own shape, the sun and rain.
And around this space, we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how do we close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that would lead to local weather conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar fabric of a concrete <unk> with <unk> to allow the air, and also in the light, but in a <unk> way.
And then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons on the dressed of the <unk>
They have properties of the fractal geometry and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled by the inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little colors of colors that use light crystals in the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it didn't be easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a shopping mall. It wasn't what we would expect.
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of the market was going to be much more profitable than the commercial center because in order of accounts there were more local.
And then the idea of the facade was significantly cheaper -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but it was also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we got certain savings in the budget that we used to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy <unk> for the building in a city in which the electricity cuts down almost every day.
So we get a big advantage by putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, which are set up water to the inner <unk>
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to do a project that is so large that the biggest that I have ever designed, it needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also to their environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention to the <unk> a thousand years old that was surrounded by a dozen of a dozen connected access to almost straight lines.
When I went to place, the first design operation, we did it was to expand the streets and create 12 similar early blocks and the characteristics that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some strategic dots in relation to the idea of <unk> doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the small cell of the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk> climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house, and therefore a natural ventilation.
So we <unk> a framework that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the low plant we have all the connections to the pedestrians.
And it also responds to local standards that make greater density at higher levels and a lower density in the low plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost as giving out of the community the full space of construction.
It's where all the neighbors, you can go up and get them up and make such a business like a couple of miles in the morning, or to jump from one building to another building.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where we can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes local communities and local economies at the same rate as buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment that they have to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
It had a very bright little bit of very brilliant hair and a little <unk> of pencils cute -- it was super hard for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of <unk> until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I got a time after the school <unk> I was a little late and <unk> me in the bathroom.
When the coast was salt, I walked into the classroom, I took off my teacher from my teacher to my grades.
And then, I did.
We were <unk> from my <unk> just a little bit, just a few <unk>
All the <unk>  And I signed up to bring my book back to the <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had very good notes as well.
And so in a <unk> I mean, the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put up all rows of <unk> and myself a row of the way, just by being there, because they <unk>
I'm still surprising what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came out.
I don't understand why I felt good at it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It was all obvious <unk>
I would never stand up.
But most of all, I <unk> the reason why I was bothered by this little girl, so small, it was so good for me.
I <unk> jealousy.
They are so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
The primates. <unk> birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that would take the loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because the novels are like the lab that we study in all their possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there were no <unk> <unk> there would be no literature.
Well, it wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> no <unk>
There would be no king <unk> or <unk> and a <unk>
There are no Shakespeare.
<unk> the reading lists of high school lists because we would be missing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without <unk> I know it's fashionable -- I know that <unk> has the answers for everything, and, in terms of <unk> they have all of them all.
This year will be seen 100 years of his work <unk> "In the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also <unk> <unk> my God, everything we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think about a kid trying to reconcile the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk>
I don't know how the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It will be very obvious like the <unk> that are reduced to the person, to their desire, their <unk> are a narrative base.
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
One story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel wrong.
Being at the time and audience and audience, we know exactly what the details of the <unk> to nail the knife <unk> right?
The <unk> are made to all novelists <unk> and that's something that I understood understood.
Everything that she makes to give me pleasure could give me pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And he starts saying to himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every fresh charm that <unk> detects in his lover, he adds it to his collection of instrument of instrument in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break up with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion <unk> You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> you like the big masses of bright hair, and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> looked at the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links the language of the jealousy.
When you're going to be in their <unk> coffee agony behind the doors and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then defending those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not unlike an old text interpretation or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's <unk> research with real value value.
<unk> is trying to show that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem like <unk> but in their <unk> they are search of knowledge, a truth painful -- in fact, what to <unk> <unk> the more agonizing the truth, better.
The pain, the <unk> <unk> These were the pathways to the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs that we need to deal with it causes us to <unk> a range of much more profound and vital feelings that a wise man could be <unk>
It's telling us that let's go for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> tell us ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us <unk> this particular way.
Is there any other emotion to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other excitement that teaches us to look at extremely <unk>
Freud write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very <unk> young woman who was eating with the idea that his wife would <unk>
And Freud says there was something strange in that man, who didn't get <unk> in what your wife did.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that his wife, <unk> his wife, <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious of his wife.
<unk> are really good at this.
The novels describe really well how the <unk> are making us look at intensity but <unk>
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, more we become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent <unk>
<unk> drive us to behave in completely <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about myself at the age of eight years, I think, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman from Michigan from 52 years old was captured by having created a false account on Facebook from the one that would send <unk> <unk> for a year.
For one year, every year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former former <unk> <unk> I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
What massive, even though <unk> creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel by Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a brilliant very strange and brilliant character of the American literature.
It's the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books trying to make the <unk> <unk> and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of the <unk> the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Let's take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want what you have to look at you from your own and <unk> of what you ever <unk> and it's under the floor. <unk> your <unk> takes your rings, your bank bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> all the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in a time of envy.
We live in any times of jealousy.
I mean, we're good at social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> show us <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when they're not sure, when they're in a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and asked by <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> you think about the curse -- in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always done <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> face of <unk> <unk> that needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius, but it bothers you.
Oh, my sounds so <unk>
You know, it needs its help, but it <unk> it and <unk> with <unk> in each of the mysteries.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> once you <unk> <unk> <unk> all of your solution, <unk> back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And it tells you that there's no person in <unk> <unk> who didn't want to <unk> your hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> were in history. It seems to me very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It looks like a problem of geometry, without emotion.
You know, at a minute <unk> is the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute they are on the same side.
All of a sudden, it was allowed to admire that idea of being the <unk>
Could it even be so simple?
What if <unk> really are a problem of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to have the greatness <unk>
We can relate to it.
But I like the <unk> plans.
So as we hope that that happens, we remember that we have fiction to <unk>
Only fiction <unk> jealousy.
The fiction used to <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what <unk> sweet <unk> the scary Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the great <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
And the 21st of July of July Buzz Aldrin jumped outside the <unk> on Apollo 11 and landed on the Aral Sea.
Armstrong and <unk> were alone, but their presence in the gray surface -- this was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the greatest promotion in history in American history.
To reach the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of a day today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave a about 400,000 people and asked <unk> collaborations and universities and government agencies.
They died, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program -- 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked over his surface, from which he agreed after the death of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They didn't bring a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of the <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> the cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to show the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the first words of Kennedy at the University of Rice <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some people ask, why do it <unk>
Why turn it into our goal?
And then you might ask, why will it scale the most <unk> mountain.
35 years ago, why would you fly about the <unk>
Why does he play Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the Moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo was not just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> to the transcendence of the powers of technology.
They were because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing on the Moon happened in a very long context of a long list of technology.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line, and the airplane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, the <unk> and the <unk> of smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what we Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a horse with candle but in 1969, the Apollo crew flew 40,000 miles / hour.
From 1970, no human being has gone back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the optimism joyful about the power of technology has been <unk> by seeing that the problems that we imagine was going to be going to be able to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feed the world population seem to have a result of <unk>
I remember seeing the Apollo <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't get to the escape escape tube of the rocket and Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last single mission -- but I was completely sure that I was going to see the colonies on Mars.
So that "Something's involved with our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard this for the last two days here, at TED.
It seems like the technologists would have distracted us and have enriched enriched toys, things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed up the <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They have expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There is a <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, that they have created less ambitious businesses than <unk> from the years in which they were <unk> <unk> Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, specifically the incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs for entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the investment of risk caused the creation of ideas that are driven by the funding of <unk> problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It's mostly going wrong with <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their high point without worrying about the risk, they preferred small investments, a case of which they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest in technologies like energy, which need a huge amount of complexity and whose development is over the long term. They have not invested in the development of technologies intended to solve large problems because they don't have a commercial value right away.
No, the reasons we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we are choosing to do the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars it would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We don't go to Mars because everyone thinks there are more important things than to do on Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption comes from sources of renewables like solar, wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want alternative energy sources that can compete in the price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists are according to what policies and international treated the development of a <unk> energy, <unk> a significant increase in research and development development and some kind of the price of carbon control.
But there is no hope in the current political climate that we're going to see an energy policy policy in America, or international treaties that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that looked like technological, not to be.
We know for a time that famines are a result of failure in the <unk>
But 30 years of research has taught us that famines are political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like food or systems for the storage and <unk> of food, but there will be massive famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon was declared the war to cancer in 1971, but soon we discovered that there are a lot of cancer, some incredibly resistant to the treatment, and only over the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
<unk> problems are difficult.
It's not true that we couldn't solve the problems with technology.
We can and we have to have -- but these four elements have to be <unk> and political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> it must be really a problem -- and we have to understand it.
The mission <unk> that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve great problems with those criteria.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no competition in the Cold War, and the Cold War, there's no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> how hard and dangerous, and there's no popular science fiction science like exploring solar system.
In general, go to the moon it turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I didn't even have any problem whatsoever.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> ideas that you have about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> from our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there have been a huge decrease of trust, it's a very widespread subject.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third one is a <unk> we should recover trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, that I think gives a more clear idea about the subject.
First of all, <unk> why people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
It makes me bow to think that it may have gone down in some activities, or institutions that might have increased in others.
I don't have that clear.
But I can show you to opinion polls and opinion polls are supposed to be the source of the belief that trust has <unk>
When you look at the opinion polls over time, there's no many evidence.
I mean, the people who were <unk> 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, continue to <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were really reliable about 20 years ago, they still have a lot of <unk> they are in the middle of the judges, they are still quite <unk>
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half the way.
But this is evidence enough?
What the opinion polls is, of course, opinions.
What else can you do?
What you look at is the generic attitudes that people manifests them when they do certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
probably <unk> by asking, "To ask what?"
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust a few but other no."
It's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit confidence.
We don't assume that the level of trust that we're going to feel for a certain kind of <unk> official or a person -- it's going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for instance, say I trust a certain elementary teacher that I know to give you the reading class, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my closest friend to keep a conversation, but no, perhaps, to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all of that knowledge when we think about trust in the way we think about confidence in a more <unk> fashion.
I think that surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real self-confidence, because they try to make good judgment from the fact of trusting something or somebody.
Second, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid goal.
It's not that the goal that I <unk>
I tend to have more confidence in what it's <unk> of trust, but not what it isn't.
Ultimately, I'm a <unk> of not trusting what is not reliable.
And I think that those people who <unk> their savings with very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right goal.
Once you say it says, yeah, yeah, OK, that means that what matters in first is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What this is about making a judgment about how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that a person is <unk> in raw commodities and it's responsible and honest, then we have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they're not responsible we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not to hurt them to get a letter to the mail -- because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that <unk> their own <unk>
And I'm glad to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are responsible and responsible for but extremely <unk>
If this is that, I haven't yet <unk>
But that's what we're going to do today before we trust.
<unk> is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
Over the last few decades, we've been trying to build systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions, professional and others, that make us easier for us to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you know, the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> I'm going to go <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we found that the system of accountability that is meant to guarantee <unk> and evidence of <unk> actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is we have the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> the <unk> as we say.
I'm sure you all know the similar examples.
We put all of that, by the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we were worthy of trust, and we would give people to the people that are reliable and whether or whether other people are, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, simple actions -- which doesn't do <unk>
Third, the task.
You go to the task of rebuild the trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But the trust, in short, is a signature because they give us other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have ever given.
You have to give them the stage enough so you can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> all of the people, all the time.
But you also have to be able to make sure that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That is a daily basis, everywhere, it makes the common people, the <unk> institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The shop where I bought my socks back, says I can <unk> without <unk>
I take them and get my money, or you change the color that I want.
That's great. I rely on them because they were vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson on that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust, and you have trust what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think what we're pointing out is not a very difficult thing to <unk>
What people rely on is relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we have been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen where the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has become increasingly becoming increasingly and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I had no <unk>
I started imagining how it would be.
First I created this tool that gets into the digital space, so that when the strong force against the screen is its physical body to <unk>
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs below the screen.
So with this tool they break the barriers.
But the two hands stay still out of the screen.
How can we get inside and interact with digital information using the whole dexterity of the hands?
In the division of Sciences about Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
And you can make a transparent bombsight with cameras deep to detect the fingers and the face, now you can put the keyboard, you can get inside of 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like the windows and the files have a location in real space, it's as easy as taking a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and you can highlight lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that is down on every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come to us?
We had a lot of us -- many of us will be bought and returned things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about it.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make physical physicists so we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical context.
This imam magnet, behaving like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as the users can move the object anywhere within this small three-dimensional space.
So what we did was we <unk> the gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> <unk> mechanical and <unk>
And to digitally program the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically physically and distance and the famous shot of Michael Jordan, you can reproduce as a physical reality the times we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and unlike the monitors or the textbooks or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what's more fascinating to change the physics part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities, everyday activities.
As you see, digital information is not just going to show you something but to start acting directly on us as part of the physical world around us without us that we have to <unk> from our world.
We started a talk today talking about a barrier, but if we suppressed that barrier, the only limit that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I took me to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1960s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to go to a school for athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution, they believed that there was just a <unk> path to <unk> a safe and good job.
No matter if work would like or not.
But my dream was to be an opera singer Chinese China.
This was me, in my <unk> piano.
An opera singer must start <unk> from very young people to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio.
But no adult would give you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Just my friends <unk> but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much higher to train.
My dream is never <unk>
I mean that during the rest of my life a second class happiness was the only thing you could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one around me wanted to <unk> Okay.
I went to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> I got to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books that I do here?
The ones that were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese life.
And it's not propaganda a <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's one thing for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and his mother."
<unk> I said. "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
I meet a new culture also led to my reading <unk>
And we had a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning of this map, I thought it was out of place because this is what students in China learn.
I'd never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to research fields like comparative comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> gives academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked to research, why not do it in life as well.
So I started reading books from two.
You can be people <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> from David <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For the <unk> the <unk> are economic economic and <unk>
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> Interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path to <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Instead of lost in translation, found that you can win a lot of her.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I wouldn't feel feeling or powerless ever.
Have a dream to broken me, it really is nothing compared to what many others have been <unk>
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect to the place that the dreams, of where the passion, where the passion, that happiness comes from.
So even a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's thanks to the books, which I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client in <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology, at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman called Alex.
And Alex walked into the first session using jeans and a <unk> stumbled on my office on my office and he took off the shoes and told me that I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> as the first client.
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the <unk> it made me easy to move my head while we were looking at the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> I used Alex, and so I was looking at, she was right.
You start working on, and then you go home later, you have children later on the death later.
For reporters like Alex and I had time to get over.
But soon after, my squad propelled me to press to Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I <unk>
I said, "Sure, he's coming up with guys under his category, <unk> with a <unk> head but it's not as if it was to marry him."
And then my squad <unk> he said, "No, but maybe it <unk> with the next.
Also, the best time to work on marriage marriage is before it <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel the head after what they <unk> but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex be a break.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect moment and we were <unk>
So I realized, that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem, and it had real consequences not only to Alex and his loving life, but for careers, families and future <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think that no one gets to the age of age without spending before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> they take away the dream -- I want to see -- it's okay. It's okay.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen to the 35 years.
This means that eight from every 10 decisions and experiences and moments that shape their life will have happened to when they have 30 and <unk>
People from over 40, I don't panic.
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact.
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live or come out with their future couple at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in its <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something that you want to change themselves, now is the moment to change themselves.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time in life and we know that the female fertility comes to her top to the 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the moment to get them on their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are critical for language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which its everyday life and common life has an impact on the person who <unk>
But what we don't hear is often something called an adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the administrators are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the time of adulthood.
The researchers call the <unk> an extended <unk>
The journalists would give him names <unk> to <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we have considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines adulthood.
Leonard <unk> said that to get great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not right?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> on your head and say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and ambition and nothing happens.
And then every day, they're smart, smart, interesting like you or your kids and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship isn't just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that as I start a career before 30, everything will be right."
But then you start sound like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better talks about the day I graduated from <unk>
And then you start sound like this: "My quotes for the <unk> were like the chairs.
They were all running, but then at some point around the 30, they turned the music and they all started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only person going to be standing, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a bit of the end, but it doesn't be <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for <unk> there is a huge pressure to the <unk> and so many of us starting a career, choosing a city, and having two or three children in a much longer period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that begin to show you, which is much more difficult and stressful to do all of the <unk>
The middle of the middle-aged age is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want to do now.
Realizing you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> look at themselves, and me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was I doing? What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because it was, in his own words, having a identity.
He said that he would like to work in art or the entertainment, but we still can't decide, so I spent the last few years working as <unk>
As it was cheaper, he lived with a boyfriend who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living <unk> very difficult life, their previous life had been even more difficult.
It will often be often in our <unk> but then she would wake up her to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose their friends."
Well, one day Emma got her head on his legs and cried for nearly the entire hour.
I had just buy a new book for <unk> and I had spent the entire morning with his whole <unk> but then you got to see the empty space that follows after the words in case in case <unk> by <unk> <unk>
I was about the <unk> when he saw me and he said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of if I get <unk>
At that time, I had a lot of work to resist and not say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that was actually <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as I worked with Alex and I just sit in the next decade, in Emma <unk>
So for the next weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma to <unk> from that identity crisis and <unk> capital capital.
For identity, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that's an investment in what you want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> career and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: this: identity capital creates capital capital.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try.
I'm not <unk> the exploration exploration -- I'm <unk> the exploration that should not count, that by the way, is not exploration, it's not exploration,
It's <unk>
I said to Emma to sing jobs and make them count.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you at the airport, but the <unk> that come together with friends with the similar minds are limited in terms of who you know what you know how to talk about, how they speak, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who would come up almost always comes from the outside of its nearest circle.
The new things come from what they call <unk> <unk> friends from friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or don't have a job.
But the other half not, and the weak links are the way we get to this group.
Half of the work created never <unk> then, knowing the head of your neighbor is the way to get a work not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is going on.
For last, but not least, Emma believed you don't choose your family, but she does his friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> Emma soon appealed to her family when she has a partner and it exists his own family.
I told Emma that time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to sit in head than 20 or even 25 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live now, or you will tell you now when you all start to walk into the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work on your marriage is before you get it, and that means to be so intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead to do is to work or kill time with whoever you nominate you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the friends with a cousin of an cousin who was working on an art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a work there.
That work offer gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend I lived alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special of events in museums.
This married a man who chose polio.
<unk> his new career, loves her new career, and I sent me a letter to me that said, "Now the spaces of emergency contacts are not sufficiently enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love about working with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are like airplanes that go from the Los Angeles, who go somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a <unk> <unk> in his trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at the age of 21 or 25 and even <unk> a good conversation, a good break, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years, even in future generations.
This is my idea worth spreading to all the <unk> that you know.
It's as simple as I learned how to Alex.
This is what I now have the privilege of saying to <unk> like Emma all <unk> <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get their <unk> and you get their rubber <unk> you choose your own <unk>
You don't define what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very tough job in <unk> <unk> for a work that was even more <unk> <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics to seventh grade schools in New York City.
And as any a professor, I applied tests and tests.
I give them tasks.
When I went back, it was about grades.
What struck me the attention was that <unk> wasn't the only difference between my best and worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance have had no I.Q. I.Q. tests.
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in math in seventh grade, safe, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every single one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during time enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure better ways.
It's the <unk> but what if you succeed in school and in life depends on much more than the ability to learn in a fast and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> scenarios and every study my question was, who is successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> Academy <unk>
We are trying to predict what we were going to do in military training and who <unk>
We went to the National <unk> National <unk> and we tried to predict what kids were driving as far as possible in competition.
We studied teachers who were working in <unk> really difficult <unk> which teachers are still teaching for the end of the year and of <unk> who will be the most effective at improving the results of learning from their <unk>
We partnered with private companies, asking what of marketers are going to keep their job <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all these very different contexts emerged a feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, physical health and it wasn't <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and perseverance to reach very long-term goals.
<unk> is to have resistance.
<unk> is clinging to its future, day after day, not only for the week, not just for the month, but for years, working hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a <unk>
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in Chicago schools.
I asked thousands of high school students who did my feelings of determination and then I waited about a year to see those who were <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly greater chance of <unk> even when they put them in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of <unk> tests, even security that children felt when they were at school.
So it's not only in West Point or at the National <unk> National <unk> where the <unk> matters is also in school, especially for kids at risk of <unk>
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little the science knows about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How develop the determination of kids?
What should I do to teach kids a robust job ethic of work?
How do I keep them motivated by the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give it purpose.
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the determination is commonly related to or is even related to proportional measures.
Up until now, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination is something called the growth."
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, are much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop purpose.
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to do.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure whether they've been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to <unk> to start all over new with the lessons <unk>
In other words, we need to be determined about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
He went in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories -- is my mother <unk> the beauty and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that time, I was struck by this incredible language.
But for a foreign foreigner, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall <unk>
In the last few years, I've been wondering whether I can break down this <unk> so that I want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do that.
I started thinking about how a new new method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each other's strokes in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic <unk>
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read signs of traffic traffic signals -- understanding the basic idea of the website or the newspapers.
Today I'll start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as possible until it is <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms on both sides, as if I were shouting at <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol actually is <unk> the shape of it, but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors of a <unk> in the old West.
I call these eight characters.
These are building blocks so they believe many more characters.
One person.
If somebody walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are company, three are crowd.
If one person stretches your arms, this person is saying <unk>
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> such as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, and we have the foundations of it.
Put a mouth over the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> to remember, because a speaker tree is quite an idiot.
Do you remember the <unk>
Two <unk> it becomes very hot.
Three clicks together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two suns together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and shining moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
One door -- put a chart inside the door, is the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> had someone at home?
This person is coming out hidden from a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, <unk> is <unk>
So we've already spent about 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical radical will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with each little effort, they will be able to learn a couple hundred and a couple hundred characters -- which is the same thing as a Chinese learn from eight years.
So after meeting the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun <unk>
This is a sun placed with the beginning, because Japan is in China.
So a sun next to start, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains, stacked over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant for <unk> because Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become out.
A mouth that tells you where to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is the films that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The film mastered his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave a good excuse for him to use a brilliant dress and take a magic wand and take a magic wand and take a magic.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of industrial <unk> a kind of industrial playground.
However, the magician of Oz was a event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend is actually took rise to 40 years later with, interestingly enough, another film whose metal boy and a <unk> kid <unk> a girl inside of the enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?  Yeah.
There's a big difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the films that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the magician of <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think that if the magician, the magician would do today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
You use magical shoes to beat the military generated by the computer generated by the computer <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the magician of Oz is that the <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I did Star Wars to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I had a child.
It's only three years old.
It wasn't invited to projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance had <unk>  And so slid in the room and he was impressed like a mom leg with his <unk> behind, and I didn't think he understood what was going on, but he would get rid of it.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be themes of value, perseverance and <unk>
I would feel that Luke was a military to <unk> the government?
So we did this with the magician of Oz
How do you make Dorothy his film?
We do good <unk> with everyone and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world I want my children to grow up to grow up, OK?
Why is it so much a lot of modular capital -- force in the movies for our kids, and so little as a <unk> bricks path.
There's a lot of literature on the impact of male violence in male violence in girls, and they should <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know by experience that Princess <unk> doesn't give it the right framework that would have served me to navigate the world of the adults who is <unk>  I think at the time of the first <unk> I really expected them to be able to come up because it's the end of the movie, right?
My quest is finished, I have a <unk>
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The films are focused on defeat the <unk> and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a <unk> animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are many exceptions, and I defend the <unk> of Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to the children, even though them, the kids are not really their goal.
They do a phenomenal job when we teach girls how to defend them against <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend ourselves from the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women that write new stories for our children, so real and <unk> like <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful subject of all time continues on appearing on classic after classic each one of them about the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man who are friends, or two men who raised a child.
So as many of you are thinking, this year, I finally got out of <unk>
I recommend all of you. It's available in shops.
Do you remember what the criticism said when he went <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar is made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost none of these films is the proof of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's not <unk> and it's already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic artist, and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had a friend of mine on the movie assessment that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> in the film, there is more than a female character who has lines?
So, you have to get the requirement.
These women speak to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something more than the kid you like to like it?  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet I rarely see it in the movie that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality film, <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success -- an idea of consensus from what is a movie of quality.
<unk> isn't the proof of <unk>
And I don't think <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen, a lot of the movie is happening in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the <unk> crisis.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and this is the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So we <unk> in the numbers.
In 2011, from the 100 popular films, how many of them do believe they have actors of <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage of the number of women that we have chosen to Congress, then it's good.
But there is a larger number that this is going to be <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, like, he said, <unk>
In the United States, one of five women says that it has been sexually assaulted once in his life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think movie movies have something to do with that.
Nor do I believe that music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is that there's a lot of sex <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are they <unk>
What do you do not get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that the role of a male hero is to beat the <unk> with violence and then charge reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this <unk> <unk> and we want to get it to you.
We have tools to our willingness to be like <unk> <unk> and we hope that we <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> going to <unk> yes, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly parents.
I think we have to show our children males a new definition of <unk>
The definition of masculinity is radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter which was his favorite character of Star Wars you know what he <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What are these <unk>
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that you know more than nobody, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to try to reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which I tell my <unk> Go and fight and struggle and more stories where it looked like their work is to join a team -- maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine and one of the things I loved was to look at the shores of sea on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would be lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
And yet, over time, I went to <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in an love for past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw my own eyes not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown to about 3,000 miles away from length next to the <unk>
And my sea <unk> had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite imagery.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to look at it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we look at the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern delta of Egypt called <unk>
And the spot, it seems to be brown, but when we use infrared infrared and we process it using <unk> <unk> suddenly the place you see as pink <unk>
What you're looking at is the real chemical changes of the landscape caused by building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we have used satellite data to find an old city called <unk> called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Center about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire -- there were this great revival of ancient art, architecture and religion.
The <unk> always have known that it was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that the <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge area of <unk>
This area is massive, it's about <unk> by <unk> miles.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved this and covered the city.
So how do you find a city in a <unk> <unk>
And I'll try to find it at random the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes of baseball.
So we use NASA data to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this area slightly tall that you see inside the circle here, that we think it might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with British scientists doing <unk> jobs you can see here.
When I say <unk> is how you take it on the ice, but instead of <unk> climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five meters down, below a thick layer, we find a dense layer of <unk> objects.
So this means that in this possible location at the bottom, five feet down, we have a layer of occupation in several hundred years that date from the Middle Empire -- exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> and quartz and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk>
This might seem that it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones they used in the jewelry of the Middle <unk> these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a <unk> dense layer that goes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a fancy jewelry shop that shows that what's been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but we went to the place in a near future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire -- probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
Let me share the knowledge is the biggest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So the TED seems not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the ideas actually started in 1984 B.C. in a lost city not for a long time and found from the high time.
It certainly puts the search for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, front of the door <unk>
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's made.
Now we <unk> a group of <unk> obese group on cars.
They are competing in a <unk> race and they're going to address their front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide in front of your doorstep.
There are bicycles flying everywhere, wheels on the side, wheels on the side of the wheels that end up in <unk> places -- the threshold of the door, and the door of the door, you know.
<unk> in the hall, or what there is on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of light. The light is shining on the <unk> of <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
It was from his chair on a brown horse.
It's a horse that is talking about.
You can feel your blue fur, your tickle your nose.
You can smell the cookie cookie and you're about to get into the mouth.
They walk around and enter your living room.
In the room, and doing the maximum use of your imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothes, dancing about his <unk> singing <unk> <unk> One More <unk>
Now let's go to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a path of bricks and from the oven coming to you -- the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition, which is happening every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk>
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, I guess, this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages ladies and different habits of sanitation.
They were putting hundreds of numbers out of them, looking at them just once.
It <unk> the names of tens and tens of strangers.
It creates entire poems in just minutes.
He was trying to see who could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people have to be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England and have one of the best <unk>
I said, "Well, when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed <unk> "I am not a wise.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everybody who participate in this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have been trained to perform these miraculous memory acts by using a old old techniques invented by two billion years ago, in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their speeches and that academics medieval used to memorize <unk> books.
And my reaction was: How did I have no heard of this <unk>
We were standing outside the room of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English man, even though a little <unk> told me, <unk> you're an American scientist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
"Because I would like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of <unk> live on national TV.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start for something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the next year not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very likely with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that he had a <unk> problem, is amazing.
Somebody incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed to see what our memory is making us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the paper of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent one afternoon together in the public library, from Salt Lake City, <unk> guides <unk> was <unk>
And to come back, I read a lot of treaties on science written over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Dark Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time that this idea of having the memory of the memory of the <unk> <unk> and that was not such as rare as it might look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, in providing <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they also changed us.
We have changed the texture, and I would say that we have changed a cognitive supply.
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes we seem to have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you are still passionate about this idea of a <unk> memory of <unk> <unk> and ours is this very specific competition of memory.
It's not really so <unk> there's a lot like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College in London invited a group of memory champions in the lab.
They wanted to know that it has brains in some sense, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are you more intelligent than the <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test, and the answer was actually not.
There was a really interesting difference and significant difference between the brains of memory champion and the control subjects with the <unk>
When they put them in an MRI machine, they <unk> their brains while <unk> numbers, faces and shapes of <unk> they found that in the memory champions <unk> parts of the brain, different from others.
In effect, they <unk> or seemed like <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament for <unk> <unk> is driven as an armed race where each year, somebody has a new way to remember more things, and then the rest of the competitors have got a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory.
On his desk, there is 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> who is about to try to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and that he just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
In half an hour. Yeah.
And as there is a lot of ways to remember things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques that are used by the end of the end of a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
This is illustrates with a elegant paradox like <unk> paradox -- <unk> says this: I tell two people who remember the same word, I tell you to you, <unk> that there's a man named <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I'm asking you, you know, there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them, I ask you to <unk> that word I told you about a <unk>
What do you do?
The person who was told that his name is Baker is <unk> it's unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told to be told that his job is <unk>
The same word, different <unk> capacity, that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, doesn't really mean for you. It doesn't have any relationship here.
with all the other memories that dance for their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use white <unk>
They have <unk>
They do well when they come home to work.
Probably <unk> some <unk>
And when we were to <unk> that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point back.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this is a half thousand years ago, in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> which I went to a <unk>
They had <unk> as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, you didn't catch a <unk> she would join a poet.
He stood up with her <unk> <unk> his poem and he <unk> and so soon it was the room of the <unk> <unk>
They went to everyone.
But not only killed them all, but it shattered the bodies of <unk>
Nobody could say who was there, no one could remember where they were sitting.
So they wouldn't be able to do the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
He stopped standing outside, only survivor, in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with your eyes of his mind, I could see where she had been sitting next to each other.
I took the family family <unk> where their loved ones were in the rubble.
What we <unk> At that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and that is that no matter if we're not good at remembering names or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> memory and spatial <unk>
If I told you that I would give me the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to find it very hard to do it.
But I would bet that if you told them to say who I was sitting on the horse glass in their lobby, they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with your eyes of their mind and <unk> of images with the things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, the first <unk> memory <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do it with memory, the same way that I would have made it <unk> if they had been invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine you're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of absolutely ridiculous, crazy image and <unk> to help you remember the first thing that you want to mention is that <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and you can see the <unk> of <unk> on <unk>
And that would remind you, you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you'll see Britney <unk> to remind you that <unk> anecdote that you want to count.
And then they entered the kitchen, and the fourth issue that they would talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
This is how <unk> <unk> <unk> their <unk> not word for word, that it's going to confuse us with a typical typical typical mark.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> when people thought about the <unk> and in rhetoric with this kind of space terms.
The phrase <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in their <unk> of memory.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I got up with that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something extensive about this <unk> of competitive.
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
But seriously, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting on <unk> -- I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets <unk> the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things going on in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in his place.
So I began to spend 15 or 20 minutes all of the <unk> before I sit at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient school <unk> bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was a funny <unk>
I would never have hoped that he would take it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What it is actually about doing is getting better and more the ability to create and imagine these <unk> images -- <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was pretty much about this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and a pair of security glasses with just leaving two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a <unk> of memory.
I ended up coming back to the same contest that had covered a year before, I had the idea that I could go in, in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this might be good <unk> for my whole research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to be able to memorize <unk> and the phone phone numbers, and it's actually not the point.
These are just <unk> tricks.
Because they are based on very basic principles on how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> from memory or memorize <unk> from <unk> to benefit with a little bit of insights about how their minds works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was about a <unk> but it's not the case.
Great memories.
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus on deeply.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make them <unk>
It makes a kind of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of you are not being destroyed by there.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
This is how things are <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today is what I would -- the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that it had a memory problem, and I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our short <unk> existence in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walk around our side. We are so <unk> that we don't even want to be able to process in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are some incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you must be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk today about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so I just <unk> a place called New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there at my parents in a town called <unk> and this was my child's bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And then everybody passed on the television -- so every time I was going from my room to the bathroom, everyone sees me, and every time I was angry, and I came back into a tent, all saw me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> insecure and hated it.
He hated that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
<unk>
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that's the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, no division of area, but of those connections that are emotional <unk> that we feel in the places that we <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel that way, because according to Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
So 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways that we don't even notice.
That makes us a little bit naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you want, you think about <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
And I know that they think about it by based on a building built and two years ago, by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> which is using architects to create an emotional connection with the ways that we build our buildings.
It's emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long time, a long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build museums of art.
And in the 20th century in America, we used it to build homes.
Look, these <unk> stable, solid solid, front of the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who are building <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Library of <unk> which ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, he has a <unk> it has this round thing -- columns, red red -- that leave <unk> what it is about communicating with this <unk> children, the values of ownership, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, got another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both of them are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects that are constantly driving new technologies, new new technologies, new solutions for today's life.
We talked to we and we gave them so much, we got away from the people.
And all of black, this is <unk> you think we feel good, but we are dead because we have no choice.
We have to go on the other side and go back to these <unk> symbols to connect us.
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we started to experience <unk> we make a swing from back to the back and go over and over and over the last 300 years, and of course we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course in the last 30 years.
Well, it's 30 years ago in the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
That is a guess.
<unk> small, on a <unk> scale.
Something really hard.
So we get to the '80s, and we start to incorporate those symbols.
Let's take the story back in the other direction.
We take those forms that we know and the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we add a <unk> and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we turned it into a <unk> that can be <unk> <unk>
The shapes are <unk> they won in audacity and <unk>
The <unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
insane.
But they were the '80s, that was great.
We all spend a while in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic fantasies for us.
Those fantasies could be the <unk> to the French or the Italian <unk>
Maybe with infinite sticks of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy, it's cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, recreating all of other places.
I know very well, and you all know this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
We architects feel frustrated, and we started to swing the story back into the other direction.
In the '80s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols <unk> we now have new design design techniques, and we find ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that are correlated with other forms.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You get completely <unk>
Normally, the <unk> <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then, something else happened.
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when academics and public and public in general, were completely based on a building.
The New York Times <unk> this construction of <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao grew up in a half thousand percent when the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and he Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star architect.
But how is it possible that these forms, wild and radical, how it might be in ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media is <unk> around them and quickly we learned that those forms meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The same thing did the major mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon at the beginning of the new millennials happened with other star.
It happened to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects at the threshold of the new millennium, actually began to happen with all the architecture, digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think about it, for example, how they consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked up to the next town to see a building.
<unk> can take a ship, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all photographers from architecture, and the building is moving beyond its physical location.
The architecture is everywhere now; that means that the speed of communications eventually has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast, as well.
It doesn't take long enough to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings more, before we know if I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never good feedback in architecture.
This is how we found buildings like this.
The <unk> wasn't a two years old, but 20 years old.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That is never going to happen. Because we are at the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture from the invention of the steel and the <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when the story applies to media media, it starts to swing faster and faster, until it will be on both extremes almost <unk> and actually <unk> the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects and you, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional charge of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building which is <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a community on vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, the building, was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked at exactly the time, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community, that first summer, when people started to come and share it in the social media, the building stopped being just a building, it became a media, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that one made of the building.
And as you use them to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and to charge these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell us each other what we think of architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but they've changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was built today, first of the Internet in pursuit of <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can take the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell them that there is no answer to what a library can be a library today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
Architects are no longer these mysterious creatures that are using words <unk> and drawings -- and one is not a <unk> audience who doesn't embrace something that hasn't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't leave the architecture.
That means that the <unk> <unk> of one style to another, from a movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find solutions right to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the story of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad <unk> <unk> historical <unk> based on ideas that must be a stadium.
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the shapes that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings are <unk> to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking lot in Miami Beach, Florida, it can also serve to make sports or to <unk> or even one can be married there at night.
This means that three architects can dream of swimming on the East <unk> in New York, and to raise half a million dollars of the surrounding community around that cause, no longer a client alone.
It means that any building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that go to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot that builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we build.
Architects already know how to make more <unk> more intelligent, more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you.
Finally, we're not on the opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot in play.
The buildings not just reflect our society, but they shape the <unk> spaces to local libraries -- the homes where we form our children, and the <unk> step in the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it does that great, typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things you like to do for the moment is look in the mirror.
She really loves her image.
It <unk> and <unk> and it gives itself those kisses big, <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and make me think, When did I stop doing this?
How is it that we suddenly don't taste with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people look at it, "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And like any teenager he just wants to be liked and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week at school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, even though his mom tells him all the time that it's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells you it's ugly.
And between what his mom tells you and what his friends or school died, they say, doesn't know who to believe.
So a video of her own, he publishes it on YouTube, and he calls others who please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has gotten over 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talked about a normal healthy and normal <unk> who receives these answers in one of the stages of their life most vulnerable emotionally.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it driving to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost not alone.
They are under pressure to be online and available all the time, speaking, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> this is never over.
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous way, so <unk> so young.
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party in his room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that are holding with that are <unk>
This environment, to be always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of likes they have and the kinds of comments that they have.
There's no difference between a living life and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what's authentic and the <unk>
What is the greatest thing in life from someone in front of what is normal in a <unk> context.
And where are you looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news of girls now.
<unk> <unk> remain <unk> our <unk>
<unk> technique is a routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people are.
But kids are not immune to this.
Like the superheroes of superheroes in sport, and the singers are <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our children to grow healthy and be individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we are teaching our children to spend more time and effort to their appearance, at the price of all the other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical abilities and their studies and other ways they start to suffer.
Six of every 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see good enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They're fundamental activities for its growth as human beings, and as taxpayers of society and the labor of labor development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the class.
One in five are not <unk> at all the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the test season, if you don't think you see you very well, specifically if you don't believe that you're quiet enough -- you have a smaller note to the average of your fellow who don't care about you like appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland.
And it turns irrespective of what they actually weigh these young people.
So to be clear, we're talking about how you see you, not how you really are.
The low self-esteem on his body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers with little self-esteem are less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, they participate in more diet not healthy than they can bring them into a food mess as well.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people around them, and they're at greater risk of depression.
And we think it's all of this for all of this because of what they make more <unk> decisions like alcohol <unk> and drugs, diet <unk> aesthetics, sexual relations at ages and no protection and damage damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing into the healthcare system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe that they are overweight again, regardless of whether they have no higher rates of <unk>
On 17 percent of women don't present to a job interview in a day that they don't feel secure with the way you see it.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would we <unk>
<unk> this potential is interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't take you too far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three keys. The first is that we have to instill in trust in their own body.
We have to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are a lot of programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was really amazed when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children follow our children will not just have a positive impact but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six keys. The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are starting to be critical points to anyone willing to provide an education in self-esteem as it works.
A education is a difference, but to address this problem requires each of us to take charge of each other and be a better model to go through women and girls in our own lives.
It is challenging the current status of how women come and talked about our circles.
It's not good to do with the contribution of our politicians in sensing or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that the determination or the success of an Olympic athlete, depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judge people by what they are, not as you can see it.
All of us can start by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can encourage people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, When was the last time you got a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and businesses, to change our culture, so that our children will grow to be valuing all their person, valuing individuality, diversity, the <unk>
We need to put people who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them be those who go on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where they think they are never <unk> of being the people who are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think of what this can mean to someone in your lives.
Who is in mind?
His <unk>
His <unk>
His <unk>
His <unk> His <unk>
Could it be simply the woman who is at two car seats. What would it mean for her if it was released from that voice to be released from that voice to be able to have a long legs -- <unk> more skinny, a more flat, feet more <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were able to embrace this, and we would leverage the potential of that way?
Right now, the obsession with our culture with the images are <unk> to everyone.
But let's give our children the truth.
I think the way you see you is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and as they make us feel.
Get the self-esteem to self-esteem in our schools.
Let's change each one of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of age today, will become a safe change agents of themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
On November 15, 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi, <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
In fact, they were initially able to be able to, innocent but being caught by other charges -- the company of others, started planning attacks to about 12 icons in New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations headquarters for the United Nations.
And luckily, those plans was driven by an informant for an informant
Sadly, the <unk> of 1993 in the World Trade Center, couldn't escape it.
Later on, he would be convicted of its participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer, an American engineer with a <unk> mother school teacher in elementary school, between both of them did everything possible for me to give me happy.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims are coming to know.
By experience that when people take time to interact with it, it doesn't require a lot to get the same stuff in life.
However, in all religion, in all religion -- there is always a tiny fraction of people who were <unk> so <unk> their convictions that thinks that we need to use all the possible means so that everybody lived like them.
A few months before he arrest him, he sat with me and explained that in the last week, he explained to me that in the last week, he and some friends, had been going to train training in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
So we got to the <unk> throw it out, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I got my father <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to point at the goal at about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that he shot -- I gave the little orange light on the goal and to surprise from all, especially me, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle went back to others, and in Arabic, he said <unk> <unk>
As a parent, as a child.
Now, all of all, the comment took a lot of laugh, but just a few years later, I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be convicted by putting a van <unk> with 700 kilos of explosives in the underground north of the World Trade Center, causing a blast that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times. That instability during my childhood wasn't allowed to make a lot of these.
Every time I started to feel comfortable about somebody who was now <unk> and go to another city.
As I was always a new class of the class that often was a victim of <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white <unk> but it will be the new class of the class quiet and <unk> it was enough <unk>
So most of the time I was going through reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I did not develop social skills to put it together to put it under <unk> not prepared for the real world.
I was raised by the opera to judge people, based on <unk> <unk> as their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences you had to test my sense of thinking, was for presidential presidential elections.
In a <unk> program where I was involved in the National Convention <unk> in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence, as I had been a <unk> victim for almost my whole life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, towards the end of the convention, I discovered that one of the kids who had done friendship, was Jewish was his.
I took several days out of the light this detail and I realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud to be able to beat the barrier that my whole life had been made to believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came up when I got a summer work in Bush <unk> an amusement park.
I found myself with people from all sorts of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
The whole life had taught me that <unk> was a sin and, by extension, all gay men were bad <unk>
I had a chance to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I was able to see that several of them were the <unk> and less critical critics I had seen in life.
Having been a kid, I developed a sense of empathy towards suffering from others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat <unk> people exactly the way I wish to be treated.
For that feeling I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how that is the homosexual but I know what it is to be trial for something beyond my control.
Then he came the <unk> <unk>
All night, Jon Stewart made me be honest with my <unk> and helped me see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation, don't have anything to do with character.
In many ways, he became my <unk> figure on a moment when I was desperately <unk>
In occasion, the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how my thinking was changing my thinking, and she told me something to hold on my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with my eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough with endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all of that hatred in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, one day, who is trying to bring to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way. That even though I would join this ideology of violent and <unk> I didn't get to get me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it for the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, because the loss that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to speak, against those <unk> acts, like rejection to my father's actions.
With this simplicity -- I show you here as a proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race. That children don't have to follow the pathways of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you.
At this point, there's a film that is projected in their minds.
This is an incredible <unk> film.
It's in 3D and it has <unk> sound from what you hear and you see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> tastes and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your hunger, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like your childhood moments that project your eyes.
And it's constantly a voice superimposed on your conscious thought.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything directly.
This film is your conscience, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths to be human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal movie, you, you, you and you.
There's nothing to make it more directly.
At least, I know that I have a personal consciousness.
I don't know that you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not conscious, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these movies <unk>
Why are we not just robots that are <unk> what we have to do for producing results without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for a science of consciousness.
Science for nature, is an objective one.
<unk> for nature, is subjective stuff.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost the entire 20th century, we would take that vision.
Psychology was studying behavior, not the neuroscience of studying the brain alone -- but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED began, there were very few science jobs about consciousness.
It was 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for the science of <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the science science of consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some of the brain areas and some states of consciousness.
We saw something about this kind of fantastic work that introduced Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of <unk>
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain to you that this kind of work in neuroscience answer some questions that we want to explain to consciousness -- questions about what certain areas of the brain do and what are they <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> <unk>
There are no easy problems with consciousness.
Well it doesn't address the real mystery of this <unk> why all the physical processes in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal internal movie.
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon as the <unk> like the <unk> like life, and we're going to find an explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors -- how the <unk> work -- how they work <unk> how they behave and <unk> living organisms all are questions about how to work function.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we can talk about, how we play <unk> they're all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about the behavior are between the easy problems.
But the hard problem, the question of why is that all behavior is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, doesn't actually have a lot to say.
I am a real heart <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that works. For a long time, I was hitting my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we are going to get us at this point.
We have a wonderful chain of explanations -- and we get used to this; physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're conscious.
For another, we don't know how to adjust that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think the conscience, right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate our view of the world, but we don't know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning of <unk> mad, before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, he's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no such a problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the internal movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what we need to do, is to explain the functions -- the brain behaviors, and this is what it deals with everything that needs to explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a purely <unk> awareness theory based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is quite close to simply deny that awareness of consciousness is satisfying.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time that we have, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
So physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as <unk> <unk> space, space and mass.
They make fundamental laws that are <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties are not telling in terms of any more basic things.
Instead, they become fundamental, and there is the world that is built in.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, Democrats, you discovered that you can't explain electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts and space -- time, mass laws -- so I <unk> the basic laws of the <unk> and <unk> the power charge as a fundamental concept that those laws are.
I think that's the situation where we find consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space, space mass, then mass, then for the matter of logic, you've got a <unk>
The most natural thing would be <unk> as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens up the path to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect awareness with other basic concepts. space, the space, the <unk> processes.
So physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we can <unk> them in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to be able to find fundamental laws so simple that we can put them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision sometimes is called <unk> <unk> for all of us, <unk> in mind, every system is aware, not only humans, the dogs, the dogs, flies, the microbes that flies flies, even the microbes from Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with distress when he thinks <unk> always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, so no.
But the thought is that maybe photons can have some element of a crude feeling -- it will give you some primitive precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would someone think something so <unk>
In part this comes from the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental -- like space, the time and mass is natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people in different cultures, where human minds seem more a continuum with nature.
One more profound reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way to find fundamental laws to find out fundamental laws that are <unk> the thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
There is no information processing there is awareness.
<unk> of <unk> complex -- like a human consciousness complex.
<unk> information, simple information, simple awareness.
Something very exciting is that in recent years a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and I developed this kind of <unk> <unk> methods.
It has an mathematical measure of information, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And it's supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a degree of information integration, as significant as significant as a lot of consciousness of consciousness.
But when you get to the <unk> microbes, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of integration of information is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of awareness of zero.
It actually brings up a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Also, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness to the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It will take the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't talk about the reality underlying the underlying reality.
Like Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire <unk>
From vision, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is that it puts fire in equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there at the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship to nature, and it can have social and ethical social consequences.
Some of them can be <unk>
I used to think that it wasn't supposed to eat anything that had a consciousness, so I had to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll get a lot of hungry.
I think all right, this tends to transform your vision, while what matters in ethical terms and moral terms, is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask awareness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has a complicated information processing, so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, you have a lot of very serious ethical problems about the ethic of the development of intelligent computers and the ethics of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of <unk> the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or at a more local level, an integrated group as the audience at a TED Talk, right now, we have a collective consciousness -- an internal movie for this whole group of TED, different from the internal movies of each <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that must be <unk>
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually more sure of the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is a second, which is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how do those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and we love.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going through the right path towards serious awareness.
If not, well, it's probably the most difficult problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve that overnight.
But I think we will finally find it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile. It's a low education.
I went to school, I was obsessed with my friends, <unk> me with my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice -- but there's an obvious problem.
She hasn't actually gotten nothing."  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a under profile in my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> series, the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What a contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we took the disability outside of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of the teaching in high school in <unk> just after about 20 minutes at the class of 11 <unk> studies -- a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when to give your <unk>
And I said, "What about <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your speech <unk>
When the people in <unk> they talk about things like <unk> at school?"
<unk> in the <unk> room.
And it was then when I realized, this child had had experiences with disabled people like inspiration.
And we don't. And it's not the fault of the boy, it's true for many of us.
For us, disabled people are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We are there for <unk>
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> to what I do in this wheelchair, and probably you are waiting for you. Right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to make it up.
I'm here to tell you that they were lied to us in relation to disability.
Yes, we have sold the lie that disability is something called <unk> A capital M <unk>
It's something bad and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not something bad and it can't make you human.
And in the last few years, we have been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a huge amount of them.
You may have seen one, from the girl who has no hand drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with <unk> <unk>
And there are a lot of these pictures, which are what we call inspiration <unk>
And I use the porn term <unk> because they will lead to a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we have to engage the disabled people who have no disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, so bad that my life might be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you are that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that I've been talking about strange <unk> to express that they believe that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was happening before my work had a public profile.
It was kind of like me to get up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are affecting people with disability for people without disabilities.
They're there for you to see them and think that things aren't so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a difficult thing.
So let's do some things.
But the things that we are not the things that you can think.
They're not related things to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I became a so-called social model of disabilities, which tells us that we are more disabled because of the society we live in due to our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very upset with him.
It does the things that I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They are simply using their bodies taking the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do that, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says like <unk>
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they've been sold to have this lie that disability makes us <unk>
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "Oh God, you're not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And I actually know I am.
We have to take care of other people with disability all the time.
However, I don't know that I'm more lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use a little bit of <unk> <unk> to collect the things that fall down --  -- the clever trick of how to load your mobile phone battery on the battery of the chair.
Great.
We learn about the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that we <unk> and we <unk>
I really believe that that lie that you have sold us about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that is because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in a stick stretch has not done to become a <unk>
<unk>   <unk> on a television screen will not make the <unk> of <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive approach to turn all those books into <unk>
It's simply not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a <unk> girl, sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> is not considered to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of people with disability that we will be able to get away from bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of disabled people, and I want to live in a world where a boy from 11 grade in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a wheelchair.
The disability does not make us <unk> but questioning what you believe to know about it, I know that it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to see virtual reality and football reality with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, today just to answer one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think of actually <unk> they think in "Minority <unk> and in Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but <unk> reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and it will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because augmented reality change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I wear -- the Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows you to see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I tried to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you fill with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what's running by the game of play to 160 blood <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that a <unk> man like 110 pounds -- we were trying to get it out of all their being.
I've been there and I assure you that it's not nice.
So let's look at some videos to show you what this is using the Google <unk> under the helmet, give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of <unk> practices because the idea of the <unk> technology is a submarine going up to the surface.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
So a moment is a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what's going to be <unk> in the football field from the <unk> perspective.
You may have realized that we need people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of these <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk>
Blue 8, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more like a feeling being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being on the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, be their favorite players, and I've been asking me on YouTube and in <unk> "You can see from the angle of a field <unk>

We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get the next <unk>
We took it at that level using something called <unk> <unk> which surely a lot of you know about.
The Rift Valley has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why why, with this video.
Man: Oh, yeah.
No, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No.
Oh, my God, Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man on an Russian mountain, <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when I <unk> a <unk> video crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before running and making a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a
When I could be a <unk> running through the <unk> launching the ball at the bottom of the network?  Or <unk> a <unk> <unk>
What will it be their experience when you go from a mountain to over 100 <unk> like a <unk>
Maybe <unk> sales <unk>
But this is not really <unk>
It's just a virtual reality, <unk>
How do we achieve <unk> <unk>
<unk> augmented reality when the <unk> <unk> and the owners look at the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So here's a quick refresher on technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> was put on a <unk> to their field <unk> so that it would play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the game because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put radios on the <unk> <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that they are a player coming back to your group and you see the next hand you see in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you have on in -- you don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
or by memorize the strategy.
They just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose people and they hate losing <unk>
If you lose games as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But <unk> reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How would you do that?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people that's down.
You also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that's already been working.
And all that information is sent to your players.
The good teams will know <unk>
evil is <unk>
And this is the good for the good guys.
So your computer team is going to be as important as your <unk> and the analysis of data will stop being <unk>
It will also be <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that they are <unk>
They took the ball and <unk>
They went down to an open receptor -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your Norden bombsight -- you would tell you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> you know, but the <unk> system will be <unk>
It was going to be the protection of protection.
Another <unk> <unk> you have an open receptor.
<unk> the <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land. However, the receptor sees it in its bombsight -- an area of grass that lights up and your career.
<unk> <unk> takes the <unk> run and <unk>
The <unk> public, and the fans have followed each other.
This is something that will create a massive emotion on the game.
I'm going to make a lot of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable for not to be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it just as bread and workers, like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think that we can use augmented reality to encourage empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, being on the place of another person.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It creates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology for a classroom in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad are your actions from <unk> perspective.
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it is being <unk>
How much is a <unk> <unk> or a Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science instead of <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions we do, the decisions we take and the challenges we face, <unk> as always, of us.
Thank you.
So recently, I was <unk> after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years I spent the country <unk> the southern tip of the county of <unk> which includes the bridge <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, which is known to change by its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The bridge was <unk> famously, was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer who engineer at building the bridge, said that, "The bridge is almost <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from his openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will take you to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, that each of it frees up from all of your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a every free of four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks bones, some of which would be vital organs.
Most of them die in the impact.
The people who don't normally get into the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that the <unk> this method of suicide will be aware of the death of the <unk>
This is the wire.
Except around the two towers, you have 32 inches of stainless steel on the bridge.
This is where most people are in order to get their lives.
I can tell you by experience that once the person is at that edge, and in their darkest time, it's very difficult to bring it back.
I took this picture last year while this young man spoke with an official and he was looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we were successful that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
<unk> to channel the path through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> the suicide, but to the officers as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, correctional officials and psychologists train the new official ones.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him the 22 <unk> <unk> when I got a call from a possible subject, sitting in the <unk>
<unk> and when I got there, I watched Jason <unk> talking to a official <unk> <unk>
Jason had only 32 years old and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, he'd flown up to here two times before New Jersey to try to kill suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology of <unk> <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent the Earth to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could be more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out of <unk> <unk> and all sorts of <unk> against man.
The only thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped <unk> leaned on the right, and he left.
This kind of a New Jersey and smart boy had just taking his life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, my family rabbi called me to see what I was.
The parents of Jason had the order.
<unk> damage will affect a lot of people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or somebody loved it was <unk>
What do you find?
<unk> what to say?
In my experience, it's not only to talk, but you need to hear.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or say to the person who you know how you feel, because they probably not <unk>
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that they need.
If you think that someone is <unk> you won't be afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is, <unk> in similar circumstances have been thinking about finishing your life, you've had these <unk>
They go to the person in front of you can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible, and they never go to <unk> <unk> believe that there's nothing that you can do to the <unk> social isolation, and a missing interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you his letter.
She lost his son on the 19th of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and he's with her permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to their friends who tell your friends, etc.
I'm still pretty <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the party of 49 with his father the 19th of January.
He never got there.
I knocked on the police of <unk> and they <unk> it as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house and told me that the car car was down on the bridge.
I had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who may be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been before without having a real <unk> disease.
It shouldn't be so easy to end with it.
My sentences are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the <unk> Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a cemetery.
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the path that his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man who I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I replied a radio call by a possible subject by the sidewalk near the northern tower near the north.
I took my motorcycle on the sidewalk and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the course of the next, I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
And Kevin decided to come back on that lane and give it to life another opportunity.
When I came back, I turned it.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I said, "What was it that he made <unk> and gave her to hope and life else.
And you know what told me?
He said, "You are."
He stopped me to speak and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the Kevin, and I got that letter with me, and I would like to give you a <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the events of the 11th of March and you're one of the reasons that Kevin is still with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which he has been properly running.
I took Kevin when I was only six months old, completely unconscious from all of those traits -- but because of God, we now know it.
Kevin is in order, as he says.
We give God thank God for you.
<unk> debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she wrote, <unk> when I visited the General of San Francisco at night, you <unk> like the patient.
I knew I did have it to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father.
It talks openly about the events of that day and his depression with the hope that their story will inspire others.
suicide is not just something I've found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather had a poison.
That act, despite finishing his own pain, I was going to be given a chance to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people who are <unk> or those who consider suicide, they would not think they hurt another person.
They just want their own pain to go away.
Usually this is achieved only three <unk> sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and calls from suicide around the bridge.
And of those incidents I've been directly involved in -- I just lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked to him about an hour.
And during that time, I took his hand at three times.
At the end end, he looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And they <unk>
<unk> absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people we get to contact with that bridge is not <unk>
Also, those few who have jumped from the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or -- most of those people have said that the second one who stopped the railing realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't only connect to <unk> with San Francisco, but also to people.
That connection, or the bridge we do, is something that every single one and every one of us should be <unk> to do.
<unk> can prevent.
There are help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be whatever you don't are, but inside your interior you know what you are, and a question asks you, how do you become it?
I have to be a unique thing in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model, I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that I had had since I had a child.
My outside was finally going to be wrapped with my inner truth, with my inner truth.
For complicated reasons, which I will refer to later, when I look at this picture, I think, <unk> <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm getting started.
We all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the imposed constraints by the color of the skin or by the beliefs of those around us.
These are people who are always challenging the status quo of what's considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, my friends, my friends, my story.
I think this <unk> is called <unk>
This is mine.
I recorded myself as <unk> as I was born because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, and I was always wearing this t-shirt on my head.
And my mom said, "Why are you always wearing that t-shirt on the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to fix it.
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that it's a bit more complex and <unk>
Because of my success, I never tell me to share my story, not because I thought I will be a bad thing that I am wrong, but because of how the world is trying to <unk>
Every day I thank you to be a woman.
I have babies, my dad and a family who are accepting me as I am.
Many aren't so fortunate.
There's a long tradition of culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a Hindu goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight, I was at a party in the Philippines of the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman appeared in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me, this is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15, when I was still a man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the head of a <unk> beauty competition.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you ever been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if I <unk> she went out of <unk> and <unk> and that night, I won in <unk> I won in <unk> and I was a third <unk> over 40 candidate bars.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was in the world of beauty <unk>
Not many people can say that their first work was from Queen of beauty of women <unk> but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I went to remote <unk> <unk>
But more importantly, all of that, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, am I <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and he said, "You know if you gave the United States you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I was to put two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I stood in Thailand to age 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand to do the most successful surgeries of Thailand do sophisticated surgeries and secure.
In that then in the United States, it was necessary to get surgery before the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving driver's license, and the <unk> <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means being able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears looked <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and to be a model.
Many aren't so fortunate.
I think of this woman from <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was living in his truth, but that, <unk> put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All 20 November, we make a global waking waking for the <unk> Day of <unk>
I'm on this stage because of a long story of people who <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are <unk> P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't live my truth alone and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, and fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that someday I have no longer any more <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Will you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you --  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Yeah. <unk> first, thank you with all my <unk>
In my support network, my parents especially, my family, who is very strong.
I remember all the times I've been to young women who were <unk> and sometimes when they called me and told me that their parents couldn't embrace it, I would take my mom and say, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked, other no. It's just the identity of gender, that's what we are, right?
I mean, all of us were assigned to each of us at birth, and what I try to do is put on the table that some times that I've been not able to block, and that there should be a space that would allow people to do, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
<unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thanks.
In a lot of <unk> and tribal societies, parents are usually known for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for their daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending her rights in 2007. And when it was <unk> his efforts in 2011, to <unk> the National <unk> <unk> became very popular -- a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the history of the <unk> of inequality, violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when I was born a girl, his birth is not <unk>
It's not welcome, not by his father, not for his mother.
The neighborhood comes back -- it gives its <unk> to the mother and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother was <unk> a lot to have a child.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he <unk> her third daughter, he feels guilty like a criminal.
Not just the suffering, but the <unk> the daughter <unk> when it grows, it suffers from as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it's left at home and the school comes back to the siblings.
Up to the age of 12 years, in a way, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
He can play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when he comes into adolescence, when it was 13 years old, he was given to come out of his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
He becomes called his mother named his father and his brothers and his family, and if they were to remove the code of that honor, and it could even kill.
And it's interesting that this master code of honor, not just the life of a <unk> also affects the life of male family members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the <unk> of his life and the happiness of his sisters in the name of honor.
And there is a norm more of <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be very <unk> very <unk> very <unk> very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be <unk> and he accepts the decisions of his father and their mother decisions even if they don't will.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if he was <unk> with an old man, he has to <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> too young, it has to take it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson for her daughter and the same lesson for her children.
And this vicious cycle goes on and continues.
He took siblings and sisters, when he was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And so much before I was thinking about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of the freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and he called my daughter so for her.
But when I <unk> all of them were men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line from my name, and wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half years and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half years old, I was <unk> in my school.
So you might wonder, why should I mention a girl in a school?
Yes, I should be <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies, it's a great event for life as a child.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
One master to school means it's entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when they had a tourist form Canadian form and was in the relative of family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was why they value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and my daughters, thought it had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to see me.
<unk> to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and boys in the way.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson of the <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
It collects brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights and particularly for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of the participation of women in all the political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At 10 years, <unk> got up and stood up on the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper on the BBC, of the BBC, was offered herself for the New York Times, and he spoke in every platform that he could find.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and October October 2012, they shot him in the head.
It was one day <unk> for my family and for me.
The world became a big black hole.
While my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I loved my wife -- <unk> <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> told me, "Please, don't you <unk>
We have the right cause.
<unk> your life in play because of the cause of peace, because of the cause of peace, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
They were both on the right path and God <unk>
These few words <unk> a lot to me, and I didn't ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and he had severe pains and strong headaches and his facial headaches because his facial nerve, was <unk> I used to see a dark shadow.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to go, "I'm fine with my smile, and with my face.
I'm going to be okay. Please don't <unk>
It was a solace for us, and we were <unk>
We took brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist the hardest moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any <unk> <unk>
<unk> when he doesn't have his job.
They fight with his siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
So people ask me, "What's in my mentoring that has made so audacious to <unk> so brave and expressive and <unk>
I don't tell you what I did.
I don't know.
I didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> from the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I recently joined the Google group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> But all the work that I talk about today about the science of the brain, I did it before I joined Google or my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you get to a brain surgery.
You are still like intelligent or not?
It's not going to be like that, you'll be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray matter, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, from more than a dozen different chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, over the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations and chemistry <unk> and try to get them to live with life.
More than I've been saved by a time.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I was going to try to get the doses <unk> because it really doesn't exist a map that is that I say it in <unk>
I started to test with different mix -- and I was amazed by looking at how small changes in the dose -- dramatically -- my sense of who I was me, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried a dose and chemicals for a man of <unk> and I was surprised to see how I would look at my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've known several guys like this, or maybe some versions of it.
It turned out as a extreme.
But my great surprise was that it wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit of <unk> fixing a problem that had the front, and it just didn't happen like this.
So you couldn't handle it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and about what they have to do, since then I get better with men.
What was trying to get into the adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, I was to regain my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
We would think about something almost always in pictures, and that became my key point of reference -- how I can make those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were going to make new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things like this.
They thought the images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how your mind works, for me is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have a lot of great mental <unk> -- really <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take these mental images of my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a theater director was able to use your imagination just to drive the world that it has the way?
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, like the way that creative people can be able to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain <unk>
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to reaching this with two recent experiments that were made by two skilled groups in neuroscience.
They both used 3D fMRI imaging to represent the brain, and you can see the brain scan conducted by <unk> <unk> and your Harvard colleagues.
The column on the left shows the scan of the brain that looks at an image.
The column of the middle shows the brain scan of that same individual as you can see that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the contents of the central column on the left. You see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing a picture and imagine seeing that same picture is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from Jack <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They were able to convert the brain waves in visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, he showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were taking their brains to create a large pool of reactions in the brain in the video sequences in the video clip.
And then I showed you a film with new images, new people, new animals, and as long as a new <unk>
The computer, using only brain brain information is going to show you what it seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This left us <unk>
We're close to doing it.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see a picture and when you imagine that same picture, you create the same <unk>
This was conducted with the <unk> brain scanning systems available today, and their resolution was increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution of a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How did we achieve it?
There are many techniques to do that.
One is open the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer to that.
A lot of these are proposing new techniques projection techniques -- even I, <unk> with the recent result of the <unk> first of us to ask the following, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get bigger resolution, is with larger magnets -- but at this point, magnets more <unk> only offer small improvements in resolution is not increases by thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of larger magnets -- let's make better magnets.
Can we create a lot more complex structures with slightly different arrangements like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI were to make magnets really big, right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> of clever and brilliant and brilliant and brilliant solutions in <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk> in MRI systems.
At its time, instead of a magnetic field they are in the face of <unk> magnetic patterns.
So by combining the magnetic patterns with the patterns of the radio frequency processing patterns we can actually increase the information that you can get into a single <unk>
Also, we can then divide our growing knowledge of the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not just the fluid fluid, but the hormones and the hormones that I mentioned and perhaps even the direct neural activity is the dream.
Will we be able to put our ideas in a direct way to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could move over the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how to learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is something big.
These are great questions.
It would be irresistible used as a tool to amplify our skills and communication skills.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have a few choices more to open this door.
Anyway, you choose a year, to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take a lot more.
We have to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not just a traditional sense, not just gay closet.
I think we all have <unk>
His closet probably is to tell some person for the first time he loves her or tell someone who's pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have to be aware of in life.
So this whole closet is a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and have come out of that closet is universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I was working in the South Side <unk> <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I was there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> I was not <unk> my armpits, to quote the letters of <unk> <unk> <unk> like a <unk>
And I will be slope in the <unk> of my <unk> and if I had my head <unk> I would ask myself, usually a kid -- "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And it would show a uncomfortable silence at the table.
I put my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The dad <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother <unk> a cold, look at his son.
But I wouldn't say anything, and I went inside.
And I got to the point that every time I was going to a place where a child was about three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised me that the next time would say something.
So that difficult conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was prepared to get into the women's issues at the table.  I had the quotes from Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a piece of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
So I took a deep breath, and I dropped my eyes and my backs up a <unk> girl with a pink, looking at me, which is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a little girl with a question: "You're a <unk> or <unk>
So I took a deep breath, again, I set up a little bit, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something <unk>
I have the short hair like a kid, and I watched a kid, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Now, I'm a little bit more of the kind of girl from a pajamas.
And that girl looked at me <unk> paying attention, and he said, "My favorite pajamas.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all <unk> "Oh, OK. You're a girl.
What about <unk> <unk>
It was the easiest conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
Just like many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what the walls.
You just know how one feels like a <unk>
It's like my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
<unk> will give you 100 reasons for why it was more difficult to go out of his, but this is the <unk> It's not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that to explain to someone who showed you in online banking is harder than saying it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell is more difficult to tell your five year-old son than you are going to <unk>
There is no more difficult thing, there is only the difficult.
We have to stop classify what is difficult to us with about how difficult to another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we have to just feel empathy because we all live a little bit of it.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make sure security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine the same 20 years ago.
And I had a horse tail, a dress and <unk> shoes.
It wasn't the militant lesbian to fight for any four-year-old kid who would fit into coffee.
I was frozen by fear -- I was in a corner of my dark mom's <unk> my <unk> and the moving only muscle is the scariest thing ever done.
My family, my whole friends, full strangers I've spent my entire life trying to not <unk> and now the world would turn around purpose.
It was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> they kill.
One of my most memorable tourists was on my sister's wedding sister.
It was the first time that a lot of guests were in between guests knew that I was gay, and when I was doing my wife <unk> <unk> and she walked around the tables and I finally walked around the tables and I finally got to one where my friends were my parents, people who knew me for years.
And after speaking a moment, one of the women in the background, <unk> Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it is <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
So what is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite program Will and Grace and Grace did.
And you know who <unk> us <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but instead of showing you desperately their support, to get me to know that I was from my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that time, like they have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> might have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else would you ask to ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with someone, you have to be prepared for the real <unk>
That's how hard conversations are still <unk>
Ask anyone who I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of the <unk>
Now, please look at this through the <unk> perspective, but understand that what it means to go out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be real.
You know, he armor.
That girl in coffee didn't have a <unk> but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others must know we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> just <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If they tell your parents that maybe they might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
Don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex ones.
You communicate your truth.
It would never be influenced by that.
And some of them can be injured safe, <unk> by what they've done, but I'm never sorry about what they are.
And yes, maybe some people will feel <unk> but that thing in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you meet in a dark closet -- a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you might feel very they, but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the story of how the intelligence has been seen -- an example productive has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of if a machine can think of is as interesting as the question of if a submarine can <unk>
When he <unk> <unk> he wrote this as a criticism to the IT of computing as Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, we had a program to try to understand the underlying physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's take a walk.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you are from a <unk> race that you don't know anything about the biology of Earth or neuroscience of Earth or intelligence on Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason why we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you are in a alien race that doesn't know about this, that it doesn't have any concept of intelligence on the Earth, they would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, to some time over time, the asteroids that would be <unk> the surface of a <unk> planet, stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I conducted several years ago, I looked at a variety of topics through science, across a number of disciplines, that <unk> I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be honed for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that will embrace the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in our robotic movement planning, there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize future freedom in order to perform complex tasks.
And so by taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I asked them together, I have a underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're looking at is probably the most close equivalent to a E = <unk> for the intelligence I've ever seen.
So what you're seeing here is a statement that intelligence is an urban force, which acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keeping the open choices with a nice force with the diversity of possible change. Yes, even an impending future, <unk>
In a nutshell, intelligence doesn't like to go <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keeping options open.
And so, having to realize this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human <unk>
<unk> intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> during their life should have trend more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence is a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlates with the production of entropy in the long term, but it actually emerges directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> which is designed to maximize the production of entropy in the long run, in any system where you find within.
Amazingly, <unk> was able to spend multiple evidence of animal intelligence, play games, and even make money <unk> actions, all of that had to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a single foot of foot without <unk> here we see <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave him a goal.
She just decided by his account to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance is to have applications for humanoid robotics and technologies of human care.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing.
Also, just like some other animals can cooperate throwing aside from opposite opposite of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can make a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning, and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see it successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
Here we look at <unk> <unk> new connections on a social network where friends are constantly <unk> and keeps the network very connected.
This same capacity from network <unk> also has applications in health care, in energy and intelligence.
So here we are going to be able to organize the routes of a fleet of ships, discovering with success and using the Panama Canal to expand its reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, it is widely applicable to problems in defense and logistics and transportation.
And finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and run a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a series of assessment of actions, successfully increasing assets under their exponentially.
This ability to venture management will have huge applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of cognitive cognitive behaviors, such as use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation and social cooperation -- all derive from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
Let's go back to the beginning of the term <unk> the work -- the work -- there was always the concept that if we were smart machines, you would have smart rebellion that would be <unk>
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that perhaps all of these decades, we've had the whole concept of the rebellion in the other way.
It's not that machines first become smart and then <unk> and try to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the impulse to take control of all the future possible is a fundamental principle than intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise directly from taking control, instead of being upside down.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
They often ask me, how do you look for goals out of this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to go through the descendants of them to help them build artificial <unk> or to help them understand human intelligence is this: The intelligence must be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the age of stars, and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Even in the last few years, we've extended a lot of our knowledge to how the Earth fits in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, what points to Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the faint light intensity of stars when the planets go ahead of them, and they blocking a little bit of that light to us.
The data gathered by Kepler shows the sizes of planets besides the distance that are between them and their star star.
And together, this helps us understand if these planets are small and <unk> like the planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their <unk>
At the time, this gives clues about whether these planets we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this treasure trove of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The 2014 year was the hottest recorded.
<unk> and ice ice that have been with us from the millennia, now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale have been <unk> our ability to alter its course.
But I am not a weather scientist -- no <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You might say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look at planets similar to the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet, and the planets that we know better from our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little further away from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially habitable world that by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been livable in the past, and in part, that's why we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> track their surface for clues about the origins of life as well as we know it.
The satellites that are <unk> like the <unk> mission take samples from the <unk> atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
The private companies are now offering not only short space flights but also the chance of living on Mars.
But even though all these <unk> images, they remind the deserts of our planet, places that are linked to our imagination with the ideas of <unk> and <unk> ideas compared to Earth, Mars is a rather terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still <unk> places that are really <unk> in comparison to Mars.
Even in the most dry and higher places on Earth is fresh and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement through the colonization of Mars and other planets will come up with a great and sad <unk> the implication of some that Mars and the belief of some that Mars would expect there to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly <unk> Earth.
As long as I like exploration exploration -- I'm really deep disagreement with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but say that Mars will be there for preserving humanity is like imagine that the <unk> captain will actually comment that the party is going to be later on the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for the exploration of exploration and preservation is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and to improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world look like aliens.
They are just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain spaces in the hostile areas in the hostile areas, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
Let me leave you with an experiment -- the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi wanted to realize that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the Fermi paradox is that when civilizations become advanced enough to consider to live between the stars, they lose the notion of the important thing that is to protect the source of the planets that are going to develop this development.
It's arrogant to think that only <unk> colonization will save us from ourselves, but the <unk> and <unk> exploration.
If we really believe in our ability to look at the hostile environments on Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the job even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I <unk> my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized that I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that were at the dining table, where I had <unk> them.
So he tried to open up all the other doors and windows, and they were all good closed.
I thought I'd call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get to, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend from Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe in the morning, and my suitcase from my passport and my suitcase.
<unk> expensive, but sure that not more expensive than a <unk> at a night, so I thought, well, despite the circumstances of the circumstances, it really stopped.
I'm a <unk> I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases the heart rate, <unk> the levels of adrenaline and <unk>
And when I got to the <unk> of <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a long time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that could put in his place, which was a bad thing to happen.
Or at least, if you were bad things that are bad about the probability of being a total catastrophe of it.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts were not <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> who won the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed I told him that I broke the window, and I had forgotten my <unk> and Danny shared with me who had been practicing something called <unk> retrospective <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what's <unk>
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts comes and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that could go wrong, and then you try to figure out what can be done to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so <unk>
I'm going to start with the obvious ones.
At the house, they put a place for things that are very easily.
This sounds common and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make the location of the things that are important -- where the good thing is, where the fish, that places that places that are the fish, which places the tribes are friends and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone actually did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of the <unk> and they still could find his nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that are <unk>
This is the reason for losing your car keys and <unk>
So in the <unk> a place for keys, a hook on the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
It was a particular case.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you go to a place and are they <unk> with it your stuff will always be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take the cell phone picture a picture of your credit card <unk> license, <unk> <unk> by mail to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can make the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk>
So part of the hands-on practice is to recognize that under stress we won't be at the best time, and you have to put the systems in its site.
And there are perhaps no more stressful situation that when you're faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, of having to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or the one being loved to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of their medical decisions and in fact to make financial financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of choice that we need to take out of a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the physician and the doctor says, "I get the result of the lab and cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol cholesterol is associated with greater risk of heart disease, heart failure.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And you may have heard of the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> medications in the world today are even likely to know people who are <unk>
So you say, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you should be asking for what most doctors don't want to talk about and drug companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number we need to treat.
And what is this, <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or submit to a surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And you must think of what kind of statistic statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't get me wrong, something if not to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the fault of a doctor, and if it's someone else, it's from scientists like me.
We haven't understood the mechanisms that we have.
But estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of the drugs are just working from 30 to 50 percent of people.
So the number you need to treat the most widely <unk> which you think is it?
How many people have to take it before you can help one person?
300.
This is according to the research of researchers cynical <unk> and Pamela <unk> independently <unk> independently by <unk>
I just explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the medicine for a year before they avoid a single heart attack or a stroke event.
Now you might think, "Well, one chance for 300 to go down my <unk>
Why not <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for one more statistic -- and it is, <unk> from the <unk> effects.
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced by five percent of patients.
And those include things that include the <unk> of muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, <unk> five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
So remember under stress you don't think clearly.
So think about how you do this with the time, so you don't have to make the history of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out of the drug to help you the drug.
I don't say they should or not take the <unk>
I just say you must have this conversation with your doctor.
The ethical medical ethic is part of the principle of informed consent.
We have right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about if you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number needs to treat it is quite typical.
The surgery that is done in the top of the senior men in the United States of 50, the number we need to treat is <unk>
That's what it is, 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects of that case, are produced in 50 percent of patients.
Those include the helplessness or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if it's lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think of time before the questions that you can ask for the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all of this on the act.
And they also want to think about quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, you want a <unk> life free of pain, or a longer life that might have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you are trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face Face with a predator, you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism in those things, it doesn't react very quickly. You could get the lunch of the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those stress moments is the rational sense of rational, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to <unk> to think about the future to this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail again.
The idea is to think about the future how they might be those <unk> to put systems in the place that will help minimize damage, or to prevent things wrong in the first place.
<unk> on the night of snow in Montreal when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a combination of combination with a combination of combination and the door, with a key door to the front door, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I haven't ordered and lots of email messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not really organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite musical symbol of me.
It means touch.
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play <unk>
Two <unk> even <unk>
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> you can never get to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little story.
The language of French signs came over the 1970s and over the time, mixed with local signs, and developed the language that we know today like <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
And I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that the sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, now I realize it's not true at all.
<unk> are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As an <unk> person who lives in a sound world, it's like I lived in a foreign country, following their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms and norms for <unk>
So how do you understand the sound of you?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people answers.
So I have learned, for example for example.
"Don't <unk> the <unk>
Don't do a lot of noise by eating the <unk> of <unk>
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating, make sure they don't <unk> <unk>
All of this is called <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound tag on what the average person is doing it.
I'm super <unk> of sound.
And I'm always waiting for the sound of the sound, which is about to come next.
Hence this drawing.
<unk>
<unk> to continue.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the subtle <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, for me, I'm doing this with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings I only have four lines on paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic residence there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and while I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that was called the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has entered my territory of art.
Is it going to get me more of the art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that you don't just experience through the ears.
I can feel this <unk> or experience visually, or even like an idea.
So I decided to reclaim property property and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything that had taught me about the sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck by the amount of support and attention that I had.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> social currency.
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> was a kind of a listener person.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic work, or I could tell you that.
I chose to get me in.
There's a massive culture around spoken language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is kind of like no voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me just like and become my voice.
So I'm able to be relevant in the current society.
So in school, at work and institutions, I work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> his voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of value something like taking a loan on a very high interest rate.
If you won't continue to stay with this practice, I feel that I could be able to do it in the <unk> and not have any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium -- <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot be able to capture and completely express on the paper.
And the same can be said in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all of the meaning as much of the signals as the sound of the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor metaphor for the piano to understand how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
The <unk> divide in many different parameters <unk>
If it <unk> a different <unk> for each finger while the facial expression, the body movement, the speed, the shape of your hand and so, as you play the piano, English is a linear language, as if you get just one key at once.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers <unk> to express a concept of clear or idea in <unk>
If only one key would change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens with music in terms of tone <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters -- you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal is <unk>
This is the <unk> signal in that."
I'm looking at.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see the <unk> through the glasses of music?
If I had to create a sign and you would turn it over and again, it might be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and <unk>
This is all day."
If you <unk> it and <unk> the visually speed, it looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be said to <unk> <unk>
All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
This is how time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is one hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present becomes closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> too much time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea.
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of four times per <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically <unk>
Look at <unk> right hand, <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> across the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you do that with me?
Everyone with your hands.
Now we're going to do it both in my head as your chest, and something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, great.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language languages worldwide.
The second one I'd like to show you is this. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in <unk>
Now, the third one? Please go back again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good work.
Look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in my head and the chest. But it can make very different meaning.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and thriving as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have sound, it doesn't automatically have social value.
We have to start questioning what defines the social value and allow <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn how to learn how to learn music.
<unk> is a rich trove trove of, and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I would like to <unk> to open his ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can <unk> everything, but then you have to <unk>
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance -- I should say, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the awful truth.
When I get older, I learned that adults also <unk> and that they're not very good at cleaning the other people.
Time country, now I'm an adult and inspiring citizenship and invention in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait long for my students to walk through the beach <unk> with lots of trash.
So as a good citizens, they <unk> the beaches, and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans have plastic.
It's a little bit creepy.
And in the last decades, we have been coming out of these big ships and networks, and networks, these pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use those huge boats of them.
So along with my students, a ages of six to 15 years, we dream about a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> of work with <unk> so that children very <unk> can also participate.
And they will say, kids who manipulate electrical tools feel good and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and we reduce it the size that we find in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
We do.
I leave you to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to <unk> something that we hope to work.
So we decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic pieces of plastic, just providing information.
By using a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the kids would get a lot of with robots.
Then we created what we call "a <unk>
We are so quick in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we can transform light bulbs and online cameras, and we put it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see the bits of plastic floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board process is this picture and measure the size of every particle, to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this invention step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone will get it even more.
The cool thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and they're trying to solve it right away.
But my <unk> problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very well <unk>
Do you see the news, they look at the Internet, and you see it with this image: one.
A child, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning a oil spill, just using the hands of the hands in <unk> the world's largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were really surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water that they <unk> the water where they were living in.
You can also see that the water is brown and the oil and oil also are brown and when they're <unk> it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> that allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> which can be built through all sorts of substances that produce different spectra -- which can help identify what's in the water.
We had this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or looking at a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help a remote form to other children.
I was able to investigate a problem to <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further, perhaps to address a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French and maybe remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it started a bunch of giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> shredded several cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant in Fukushima, a nuclear power of the water.
And today, according to the reports an average of 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the whole Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the West coast, we can measure the radiation of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast -- and most of them -- of course, it has a safe, it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the accident and successfully communicate with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to bring the kids.
Of course they don't <unk> the parents don't <unk>
But every night we reported to the center of <unk> here you see a different use of masks here.
It might seem that they didn't take the serious work, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all their life.
Together with them we discussed the data -- that day and we talked about what we were going to do afterwards, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear energy plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigment to represent data in real time of <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
And we were able to see that the radioactive dust is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> estimate.
But based on this we organized a civil expedition, the nearest close to nuclear power to date.
We get to a mile of the nuclear power of nuclear power, and with the fishing aid of the area we were collecting sediments of the sea bed with a <unk> to measure that we invented and built.
So here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales -- also with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it has been more and more frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit of small therefore, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turned it into the larger space dedicated to the larger and environmental impact.
It's at the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, of fibers, you can basically build almost everything.
It's also a place where adults and kids can play together.
It's a place where kids of children can become reality with the help of adults, and where adults can be the other time.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the advanced age transforming its <unk> wheelchair into new <unk> vehicles.
The plastic, oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are <unk>
We can't afford to protect the children of the awful truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So scientists, scientists, <unk> we have to set up the next generation to be cared for the environment and people, and to actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two cultures of radically opposite design.
One is made of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of a silk <unk>
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic.
One puts on the environment, the other thing he thought about it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that fight for being free.
The <unk> was only a <unk>
But living creatures aren't <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we took all the information that we needed for each cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by manufacturing and production in mass.
The assembly lines have dictated a world made of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and trained architects to think of their objects as <unk> of parts of different functions.
But you don't find them <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with pores of <unk>
The skins of the back are thicker with little <unk>
You are acting mainly as <unk> the other mainly as barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there's no <unk>
It's a system that are gradually its functionality through variation in <unk>
Here is a broken screen that represents my view of the world -- the double personality of every designer and an architect at work currently between the <unk> and the gene between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the organism, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere, and the right hemisphere and the law, and it's shown in the two screens after me.
My work, on its simplest level, tries to bring these two visions around the world, heading away from assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask, why now?
Why wasn't it possible this 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment where they have four disciplines that offers four disciplines that offers designers that have never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please meet the minds and the hands of my students.
We designing objects, products, and structures and tools through scales, in a large scale, like this robotic arm with a scope of 24 meters in diameter with a <unk> base of the <unk> and <unk> to the nanoscale made of genetically altered buildings that glow in the dark.
So here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of ancient architecture, and it has created a screen where each opening is <unk> to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> this was for a <unk> fashion fashion to <unk> it's like a second skin made of a single piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with collaborator of 3D printing <unk> we printed this layer and 3D <unk> and this is sort of a seams between cells, and I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid and rigid materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a scanner <unk>
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical analytical and <unk> instruments allow to design products that are <unk> not just the way our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a acoustic chair -- a chair at the same structural structural chair and also absorb sound.
Professor Carter came back to nature to <unk> and to design this pattern of surface -- it becomes <unk>
It <unk> this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, like in nature, changes its functionality not by the addition of another material or another <unk> but <unk> it continuously <unk> the material.
But it's nature <unk>
There is no parts in nature?
I didn't raised in a religious Jew but when I was young, my grandmother told me the stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them got stuck and got to define a lot of what I care about.
As she said, "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> tree <unk>
So for that first tree, there was no difference between trunk, beautifully leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the land made the trees grow trees with branches, <unk> <unk>
The Earth created a world made out of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would design if objects were done of one piece?
<unk> a better state of the <unk>
So we look for the material -- the kind of material from the tree <unk> with fruit and we found it.
The second most abundant <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons are produced every year by organisms.
We think that if we could tune in to your <unk> we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal <unk>  We were asking a lot of husks of shrimp -- <unk> and <unk> <unk>
We make chemical concentrations -- we've been able to achieve a wide range of <unk> from dark, hard and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
To print the <unk> structures that we built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could actually vary the properties of the march and create these structures made from a single material -- feet long, 100 percent.
When the pieces are ready, you can dry it off to find a natural way to touch with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the <unk> process were used to contain <unk> <unk> that first showed up for the first time on the planet makes a billion years ago.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT <unk> the genetically engineered bacteria to capture rapidly from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition transition to the <unk> network, and if it broadens even more, to windows.
A <unk> tree. tree.
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made of skin husks in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best two: for objects designed to <unk> put in the sea, <unk> the life <unk> and placed on the ground, they will grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life on <unk>
So to do that, we must dominate the bacteria and control their flow.
So like the <unk> <unk> we did our own <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made out of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology like the liquid, liquid, only that instead of <unk> metals are <unk> new biological <unk> in very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We put our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of clothes, they were <unk> two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
She lives in our oceans and in the <unk> fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
One turns the light into sugar, the other one takes sugar and produces useful biofuels to the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution for design.
In order to hold these relationships, we have created a single channel that looks like the digestive tract that will help us bring these bacteria and to make it <unk> their function of path.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material on the <unk> device.
If we wanted more <unk> we would make more transparent channels.
This system <unk> <unk> when you stretch away from one end to another, it's 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field and 10 times more than our <unk>
And here it is, as <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels with life inside the clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> he said, "We are <unk> creatures -- only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the matter.
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin -- <unk> the damaged tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
So you always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer is actually <unk> material.
It's also known that nature doesn't make it like that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of the <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture -- a home within which they <unk>
<unk> manufacturing is about this level of <unk>
It does it by combining two materials, but two different proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the scaffold, putting those fibers in each other.
And this happens across scales.
The silk worm first went into the environment, creates a <unk> and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, is manifest in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process, <unk> a small magnet on the head of a silk worm to <unk>
We put it into a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of silk worm of <unk>
However, when you put the silk worm into a flat patch and not in a box, we realized that it would take a cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different <unk> different <unk> and we've discovered that the way, the composition, the <unk> structure was transmitted directly by the environment.
So often the silk worms were <unk> the silk worms to death inside their <unk> their silk is <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these <unk> we could shape the <unk> silk without boiling <unk>
We are <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climb this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making <unk> silk, and we put it on our site.
We knew that the silk worms <unk> into the darker and dark areas that we use a solar route to reveal the distribution of light and heat into our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat into the silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get the <unk>
We asked the <unk> of silk to a online silk farm, online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to go with us.
We put it carefully on the lower edge of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> they were <unk> They were <unk> They were <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much shorter enough.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
By <unk> the biological silk about silk <unk> <unk> give this whole pavilion its integrity.
And in a little bit more than two or three weeks, we <unk> <unk> silk worms <unk> miles.
In curious symmetry, this is also the length of the route of silk.
<unk> after <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other full cycle.
If the last frontier of design is to give life to the products and the buildings around us to form a ecology of two material -- designers should bring these two visions together.
What takes us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here is a new era of design, a new era of creation, which leads us to a design inspired by nature to a nature inspired by the design, which demands us, for the first time, that we do in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you've ever asked, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they asked them for the first time.
You can touch your fingers.
Three. Five. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English, the <unk> and the art and the art and the art site -- also playing guitar guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And usually I like testing and persist anyway, because I have dedicated a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with the time this feeling of both this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to give it up.
But then I went through something else, something totally different, and I'm going to be excited about it, and I'm going to let me absorb and I feel <unk> I've found it <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it up.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I should choose one thing, denying all of my other passions, and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad at me for not getting out of nothing.
I was worried to be afraid to make engagement, or to be dispersed, or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have asked you then.
Ask yourself, where they learned to assign the meaning of wrong or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where you <unk> what they learned about culture.
So you ask the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they were going to get to that age.
It's considered a naive question to make good answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
This question takes us over and over again, as we grow in different ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students are going to pick up at college.
And at some point, what do you want to be <unk>
It's about being the nice exercise of before it comes to the dream.
Why?
If this issue is inspired by kids to dream with what might be, it's not inspired to dream with everything that might be.
In fact, it does exactly the other thing, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, although adults well <unk> maybe you get <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  And he's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor turned in <unk> <unk> teacher and creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
Everything you hear is they are going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or real <unk> the idea that each of us has something to do during your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and devote your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected to this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that wake up their curiosity and many different things that you want to do?
There's no place for someone as one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And I feel like there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with a lot of interests and creative activities.
It's a breath to say.
It could help if you divide in three parts: multiple potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that are going to take the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the time of the Renaissance, the ideal was the one who was well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems to me as a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> like limitation or woe you must win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here are three superpowers <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
That is, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new at the intersection.
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests on cartography, visualization of data, travels mathematics and design, to founding <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates Jewish jewelry.
<unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea by his <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation is happening at intersections.
From there comes new ideas.
And <unk> with all of their background can access a lot of these points of intersection.
The second superpower <unk> is learning fast.
When we <unk> we become <unk> we're going to do it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being probable by having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of testing new things and getting out of our comfort.
Many skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything we have learned to each new zone that we can do, so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> full-time <unk> and a independent writer and an independent run.
As a kid who had an amazing ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before I become a writer, <unk> was a financial <unk>
He had to learn the smallest sales mechanics when he was starting their thumb, and this ability to write a compelling choice for the editors.
He rarely is a waste of time to go to what you're going to tell you, even if you end it up.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you couldn't have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is adaptability. That is, the ability to turn into anything that you need in a given situation in a given situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, other websites, sometimes consultant on Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and, sometimes, apparently, James <unk>
It's valuable because a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take diverse <unk> depending on the needs of its customers.
<unk> Magazine Company defined adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and the organizations that can be <unk> to meet the needs of the market, the ones that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three abilities where <unk> are very <unk> and three abilities that could be lost if they're pushed to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging people to be themselves.
We have complex problems, we have <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to address them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, specialists.
They came up with the belly of knowing because they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong for you.
In fact, some of the best teams make up a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist, can dive in deep and put ideas into ideas, and the <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are connected to how we are connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> largely will be offered to be more like their fellow <unk>
I once said this, if there's one thing that you take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the inner wiring whatever it is.
If you're a heart, then you go through all the media.
That's where you give the best of you.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realize is one of them in the last 12 minutes,   I say, <unk> with your very many passions.
Keep his curiosity through those <unk> <unk>
<unk> intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads to a more authentic life and a happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world is <unk>
Thank you.
In the year <unk> a woman named <unk> they brought her to a psychiatric institution.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until unfortunately, passed away from <unk>
After his death, he had done a <unk> and they found strange plates and <unk> in the brain of a guy that had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If you had been living today, we couldn't give her to the most help that he <unk> he gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They have been discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect ourselves from infections, many treatments for cancer treatments for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But little has been progress in Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it's going to affect 150 million who, by the way, will include many of you.
If you expect to live up to 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's disease will be almost one of each of two.
In other words, there is the chance that you spend their <unk> years to be Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or dear Alzheimer's disease.
Just in the U.S., Alzheimer's dollars costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare dollars spent the Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs increase in five times by 2050, as an increase as the generation of the <unk> is older.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest health and social challenges of our generation.
But it has been relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot be <unk> to cure or even slow its development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's disease than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research of itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times a year to cancer research than Alzheimer's disease despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what little people know, but the whole world <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, all of all, the scientists, <unk> Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy aged healthy brain, compared to an Alzheimer's disease to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to unleash a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's reduces life expectancy and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For nearly a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds out as a origami.
There are places in paper that are <unk>
And when it folds up well, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> points left on the outside.
This makes the molecules of protein <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of which step block is complex, like a bomb.
<unk> a cable could do anything.
<unk> others can make the pump explode.
You have to find the right step that it blocked and then create a drug that it does.
Until recently, most of you have reduced the wires and expected the best.
But now there are a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> <unk> physical, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've been able to identify a critical step in the process. So now it's testing a new kind of drugs that sort of blocking this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our last results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at some videos from what happened when these drugs were in <unk>
These are the healthy worms and you can see that they move normally.
These worms on the other hand, have a protein molecules that stick up with each other within them, like Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive results, but research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to defeat Alzheimer's, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to <unk> that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we <unk> it can be <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have covered more research and <unk> pressure on governments, industry, drug industry, about scientists and <unk>
That was essential to advance the HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
We see that same unit for overcoming cancer.
But Alzheimer's Alzheimer's often can't speak for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims, caregivers of their loved ones and night, they're often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So, it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not most cases of a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change they need for themselves.
They were talking about them and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I published this article in the column in the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, I do this.
The article is a psychological study that is designed to create romantic love in the lab, and of my own experience by doing it as a night of last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers are <unk> to get 36 questions and more personal questions, and then both look at your eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with one quality or skill, what would that be?
Number <unk> When did the last time you get to another person?
And they <unk>
<unk> are becoming more and more personal ones.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me to ask your partner what you like from it, or to her, I know very honest this time, and I gave things you don't say to someone you've ever met.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a really struck me with the <unk> the gadget that two of the participants had married and married and invited all of the lab to the ceremony.
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had the chance to test this studio, with somebody who I knew not particularly well, I didn't wait for <unk>
And yet, we were <unk> and  And I thought it was a good story, so I send him to the column Love <unk> a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you probably ask you guys -- you probably just follow it together.
And the reason I think you're familiar with this is because they've done this question again and over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before I was published the article very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had told me to write about my experience in romantic love to my blog.
But a blog blog can reach a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just my Facebook friends and I imagined that my article in the New York Times would have probably a few thousand views.
And that came a good burden of attention into a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The article was published on Friday night, and then on Saturday, this happened on the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, there were already called the "Today <unk> and the Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article got over eight million <unk> and I was like, for saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust by writing about own <unk> experiences, but another thing is to find that life of loving life, and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, they always did the same question: They were still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the <unk> of my email with the phrase: <unk> <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers are like this.
I was interviewed in radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman yelled at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately put it up.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable about it.
But I was not prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article for San <unk> who included the experiences of readers to test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both made a public onset together.
<unk> TV interviews, and <unk> orders to take pictures of us two.
I think I was afraid I became the icons that I was afraid to become a <unk> process, a range for which I didn't feel at the absolute <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know whether the study worked -- they wanted to know whether they really <unk> I mean, if I was able to produce love <unk> not just an adventure, but real love, <unk> love.
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months and felt, above all, that people asked the wrong question.
How do you know if you put together together or not, and in addition to <unk>
If the answer was no, I would do the experience of making these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead of that, I tried to foster interpersonal approach, between university students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
Participants were felt closer to the participants after doing a number of later studies -- they also used computational studies -- <unk> <unk> as a rapid way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They've used it between members of the police and the community, and they used to be used among people of the opposite political ideology of people.
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately never <unk>
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little <unk> liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "You want to say that you would tell you about the person who <unk>
Well he did a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that they did get better to know better after proving the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking at when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult separation here.
I had had that relationship since I had 20, what was supposed to be all my adult life, and he was my first real love and I had no idea how or if I could live without him.
So I think about science.
I did everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that to be a kind of <unk> <unk>
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I just went through the book that I wrote but in retrospect, it really seems to be <unk>
I thought that if I was obsessed with romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and I used to feel like that then.
And this whole knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demand what I after.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably well can demand me.
What I'm looking for for love is an assurance not just being <unk> today, and it's going to be <unk> tomorrow, but I'm going to keep standing indefinitely by the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that people ask when they wanted to know whether we were still together.
The story that the media told us about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to mitigate some of the <unk> risk, and this is a very <unk> story, because in love with us to feel beautifully, but it's also frightening.
But I think when it comes to love, we are very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The version of the story that says, <unk> are still together?
And its content with a <unk> response, or a No.
So more than a question, I would say we're asking more difficult, questions like, How do you decide who you deserve your love and who doesn't it?
How do you stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how do you live with your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more thoughtful conversation about what it means to love somebody.
So if you want the brief version of my relationship, is a <unk> a year ago, a known and I apply a study designed to create romantic love, we will <unk> we still follow together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love it's not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article. The love didn't happen.
<unk> fell in love because we took the choice to be.
And <unk> a little bit of reading it now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, I hadn't considered everything I was supposed to do.
I didn't think I would have both of us to make that decision, and how much times it will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he always will choose or not.
I want you to be done and say, 36 questions, I'd have chosen to love someone so generous, and kind of fun and have expressed that choice on the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe.
And what we <unk> and what I might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending to implicit in the title of my article, which is, by the way, the only part of the article I didn't actually wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose to love someone, and the hope that he would also love me and it's scary but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a couple of <unk> and in a way, I got a <unk> of the forest <unk>
One of the New York City takes a time.  Something that really affected me but more details later.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of <unk> and <unk> a dollar, a dollar, and a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species, <unk> ideas, for example, how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has fun because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment since I was in <unk> <unk> I like to go from a tour and make <unk> and all those things <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took him all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> I went into the style Agnes Martin, I covered it in resin and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking he could <unk>
Instead, it happened the opposite: in some ways it seemed to grow as a size, as if it was that we had the text with a <unk>
So I did? I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding these electronic elements, strange bottles that I was finding out on the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow from you, draw like drawing a <unk> in the crime scene.
And I took objects out, and I created my own taxonomy of specimens from <unk>
First of all, you know that you can get an idea.
Then I did some insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I became interested in the human form, sculptures of <unk> natural sizes with drawings of human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the <unk> was going to kill.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing in the layers of glass, similar to the drawing on a window then in another window, and another window, and I had all these windows together that make a three-dimensional composition come together.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big, that I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by a big measure in "The garden of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting in the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
Do you know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of their time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
Five meters long.
It has double <unk> so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with heads of animals travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, to this <unk> <unk> where they <unk>
This is where the creatures with heads of animals are headed to <unk> lists of <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is composed of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the concert of Osama bin Laden, there are all sorts of weird things that you can find if they look very well on the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while from the other hand, they get clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a mythological power, which holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a little story.
That's the hand in which we <unk>
And then, when you go on the other side, you have a <unk> like a bird, and it spits out clouds of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> tail. a <unk> tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, its tail on a <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go around, you know.
His tail ends in a <unk> <unk> made of suicide cards in 1986.
They have <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of the terrorists.
It brings me to my last project.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each of us is a archive of our culture, through media and material being <unk> dictionaries.
But each one acts as a kind of archive in a way of being human, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They are like cells, they come together, they're <unk>
And you can walk between them. It's getting years.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 3,000 pounds of a human being trapped inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest, you can <unk> the entrance to you.
I'm going to play you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and you cover the penis or <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick primer on these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see layers, you can see.
This is a game in half.
This has two heads and is communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and come into the head of this strange <unk>
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes we live in.
We're in a box, solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a <unk> box. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a musician, a <unk> a school, a publishing arm that spreads all the content we do in the world, and a garden.
<unk> the box and all the people in it hits each other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you get to <unk> who is and the box in which it's living on.
And together we get to realize that we are all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first of the stomach, the <unk> and other organs.
You take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system so that any drug is going to be affected by the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take drugs, they serve them to decrease the number of viruses in the blood, and increase the count of blood cells.
But they are also known by their side effects of <unk> in their negative, because in the time you take it into the current hand you get to your hand and get worse than the time you take it to fate, which is more important, in the HIV condition.
These are regions of the body like the lymph creatures, the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the blood stream of patients who are tested to regular drug drugs.
However, after the treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drug treatment that is a treatment for life that is being oral <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> I would get the treatment directly to the storage of the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As an scientific scientist at <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for health care and surgery and diabetes, you can be used for anything else, including transportation <unk>
In fact, we are now using laser pulses to open or <unk> holes that open and close holes -- and close it down, almost <unk> cells with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people are asking, "How is that <unk>
We send a small and very powerful beam of the cellular membrane on HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser passes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug on a matter of <unk>
Before you even know it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or plates of <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a three head.
With the first head, which is our laser, we will make a <unk> in the site of the infection.
The second head -- which is a camera, is moving to the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases it directly into the site of infection, whereas the laser is used again to keep cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to total HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of the whole researcher of the <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups of armed groups like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
They have what these groups do when they're not shooting at all.
My goal is to understand the best to understand these generators agents of violence and study ways of encouraging violent participation to violent confrontation, not violent.
I do business work in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding for these groups is key to solve almost every single conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a <unk> between states.
Not anymore.
It's now a conflict between states and actors.
For example, from the <unk> arrangements of peace arrangements between 1975, and 2011, <unk> had between a state and an non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even need to be <unk> or <unk> in any local conflict resolution process.
But how do you do that?
We have to know what they motivates these organizations.
We know so well the reasons why they do it, but no one analyzes what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed fight and the policies are not being <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global view.
The armed groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for his violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in 1980, <unk> has also established a political party, a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza from 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
They're multitasking out.
We put a complex machinery of <unk> stations of radio, TV channels and Internet web websites and social networks.
And here you have the <unk> <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
The armed groups are also investing in a complex fundraising fundraising but through <unk> business for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funding, to recruit better and build their brand.
<unk> groups also do something else: they create stronger bonds with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, run out hospitals, put in professional training programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
<unk> groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state of <unk> security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in an Afghanistan torn down the war or even the beginning of <unk> <unk> can also understand the efforts of these groups to provide safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a quarter champion high for the population.
But in general, providing social services means filling a vacuum, a <unk> gap by the government, and allowed these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006 of the Palestinian Hamas can't understand without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario. Even in the West, when we look at <unk> groups we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill gaps in the government, and come up as armed and political groups participate in nonviolent struggle and governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated organizations, are these organizations, we can get them as opposed to a state.
How does a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a territory, run through all of their <unk> collect the garbage, run the system of <unk>
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations without state and hybrids and the weaker the states, like in the Middle East the <unk> and fill that gap the non-state actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups are going to have to invest more in the military tools.
You know, the government vacuum has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If we understand groups better -- we will understand what incentives you will offer to foster the transition from violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors, the military power can win some battles, but we don't have peace and stability.
To get these goals we need long-term investments to fill that security, to fill that security gap that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure like a woman, and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the openly <unk> label would be unfair for <unk>
I'm a feminist, but pretty bad.
And therefore I felt like a bad feminist.
Or at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> and then in interviews -- people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me take a step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and 20 years, I had strange ideas about <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and they hated sexual <unk> as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated and women around the world and anger, in particular, looks like a perfectly reasonable response.
But at that time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people <unk> that might be a feminist idea.
Being labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and nasty word.
I would tell me as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is <unk> with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and he can't imagine being another person.
With the time, as I was growing up, I started accepting that I am, in fact, feminist, proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
They did the same money for the same job.
We have the right to travel around the world like <unk> free or violence.
We have right to use it so easy and accessible the contraceptives and the reproductive services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> or doctrines to <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There is more.
When you talk about the needs of women, we have to have in account our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender gender, religion and <unk> and skills and a lot more.
We have to have in account these differences and how we behave in the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear, I am a mess.
I'm full of contradictions.
There are a lot of things that make me a bad feminist idea.
I have another confession.
When I lead to work, I listen to rap music to <unk> all volume.
Although the letter degrades women and offends a profound thing, the classic <unk> <unk> of the yin yang <unk> is amazing.
He was actually with your shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you <unk> the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely overwhelmed by my musical results.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the <unk> tasks -- but they also kill insects, the collection of garbage, simplicity <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
It <unk> from fashion magazines and beautiful things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the <unk> fairy tales that are made true.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, he is her choice, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise her children, I hate that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes vulnerable vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women be economically vulnerable when they <unk>
So we had this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has bypassed or enforced the needs of women's women in color, family workers, <unk> and <unk> in favor of white, white, <unk>
<unk> if that's good feminism -- I'm a very bad feminist <unk>
It also happens the following: As a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we're going to make it seamlessly.
When we <unk> we take them with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I consider myself to be <unk> from that <unk> before I try to put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and leaders of the sector, are afraid of being <unk> like <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm a <unk> fear of what that tag is going to be -- fear of not being able to be able to do with a little realistic expectations.
Take <unk> or like I call it <unk>
In the last few years, it's a <unk> feminist <unk>
In the <unk> Music <unk> Music <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show to see this star in the pop star <unk> feminism was going to know women and young men being feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, cultural critics have endless arguments when they were <unk> was or not a feminist thing.
He risked his feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection from <unk> because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much <unk>
We go far beyond the sane criticism and <unk> to <unk> feminism feminism <unk> until there was nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
Bad feminism or rather, feminism feminism is <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give the day, move to action and be a little <unk>
If I hear music music, I'm creating a demand for artists that would be happier to providing a supply of limitless.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until we <unk> the change affecting effectively their profits.
It's certainly difficult.
Why has their music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions justify this makes it more difficult for women to get equality, gender equality that we all deserve to and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> <unk>
These are two girls and <unk> and brilliant, and also very brave. I want to grow up in a world.
They were overwhelmed by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice would be <unk> as much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program comes to sexual violence against women as sport, <unk> the <unk>
We can change the radio of radio when we listen to songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema anywhere else when movies don't treat women as well as <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports sports where athletes treat their peers as <unk>
In any case, men, especially young men and heterosexual men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish his magazine, participate in his project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a number enough of women, so much to be able to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but we're going to be able to participate in these kinds of projects, and we can also engage them to be even more like us to get to overcome the barriers to decision jobs.
We are not <unk> <unk> without these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our accomplishments are going to mean very little.
We can make these small acts of bravery and hope that our decisions will go to the top, to people in power directors, and music producers and music and music -- <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create meaningful and meaningful change.
We can also say with bravery our beloved good, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist -- not to be <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I say, most of all, because the old voice, my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to address what happened.
These were a few kids excited about me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it wasn't anything.
<unk> my voice, and after everything I didn't believe me to believe that I could say something that could matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of women who looked like me and understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that it wasn't anything.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, also I discovered that if I was a little courageous, another woman I could see me and see that none of us is nothing that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to do anything.
And on the other, I argue the <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I'm a good kid, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little courageous, when you need about such a threat.
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> for having visited <unk> or by being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went across the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the exciting things about this outbreak is that the <unk> which may be terrible for a child with an immune immune system, is one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but a lot of the kids involved in the outbreak <unk> hadn't been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly <unk> the autism.
But a moment, was not the article that unleashed the argument about autism and vaccines <unk> <unk> and marked by being an appraisal fraud for the British Medical Medical
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents all over the world remain <unk> that vaccines will put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the increase of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about her creating all their professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates continued stable only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the '90s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> fundraising as <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic as if I could catch from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If they're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people to the Disease Center for Disease Control what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic diagnosis and "a better detection of <unk> to explain these numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who seeks the face of her two years of the <unk>
If the criteria of diagnosis had to be <unk> why they were so <unk> at the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so difficult to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> of science than with the power of storytelling.
During the most part of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients that looked like <unk> private worlds, <unk> people around me, even their own parents.
They could fun for hours waving their hands on their faces, but they could be prey to panic by <unk> like when they didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place, without knowing them.
On the basis of patients in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
By the years of 1950, as the main authority of the world on the subject, declared that I had seen less than 150 true cases of his syndrome as we had <unk> of places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis was very <unk>
For example, we will give that diagnosis to children with <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he was <unk> that he had become nine from 10 children sent by other doctors to his office by being autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of child <unk> it caused by cold parents.
These kids, he said, "You have kept it carefully on a refrigerator that doesn't <unk>
At the same time, however, I noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that they cluster in certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could tell between 18 <unk> before they turned the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records he properly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills saying things like the kids were simply <unk> what they had heard of their parents -- they were desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Now, amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s, the researchers started to test the <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist, and I thought the theory of <unk> mothers from <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John was warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like <unk> without support, without special education, without a diagnosis.
To stand at the National Foreign Foreign <unk> they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should be done for 30 years before.
They ran a prevalence study of autism in the general population.
We took a suburb from London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw of clear was that the model of <unk> was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more colorful, diverse and diverse interests.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, in the dinosaurs or in the <unk> of the <unk>
In other ways, these children didn't fit in beautiful paintings and <unk> as they said <unk> and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did no one realize these kids before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article published in <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then he was buried buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even an English translation in English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> speak German, and he was doing it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
Her author was a man named Hans <unk> who was leading an integrated clinic with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for <unk> standards.
The morning in their clinic started with kind of exercises with music, and kids followed their games at the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as a <unk> disability for life that required <unk> <unk> and <unk> spaces throughout the course of all life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic like patients, Asperger's called their little teachers, and he started helping to help in the development of education that were especially right for them.
<unk> Asperger's saw autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of empathetic and disabilities.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and always have been, seeing aspects of this continuum in architectural <unk> in the pop culture as the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say that for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong with that autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that were called <unk> <unk>
At the end of the '80s and early '90s, their changes in <unk> by using the limited model of <unk> by a broad and Asperger model.
These changes don't all fell into a <unk>
<unk> when we were to <unk> and Judith working between these <unk> people around the world to see an adult adult adult for the first time.
Before he came out of <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> recognition of <unk> <unk> psychologists, teachers and parents around the world knew what autism.
At the same time, the first time were introduced to the first easy clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I shouldn't have a connection to that little cycle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of the autism consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started to <unk> the same as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact expected that it was expected to get people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and services that were <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines by the increase in <unk> and a simple powerful, powerful, seductive history, as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the prevention of prevention that one of all 68 children in America are in the spectrum, it's right, the <unk> are one of the largest <unk> groups in the world.
Over the last few years, autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that the puzzles are for solving for new medical breakthroughs -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think of in terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> <unk> and it suffers from a attention deficit to detail.
No doubt autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> that I believed that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are in the understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, supportive communities, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the boat of the <unk>
As we go into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to afford any brain.
Thank you.
